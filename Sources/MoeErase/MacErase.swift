// Erase Memoe from this Mac — docs/CLOUD-REMAINING.md D9.12.
//
// **This file deletes a person's data.** Everything in it is arranged around
// one question — *what may this touch?* — and the answer is always a list
// somebody can read, never a pattern:
//
//   * paths are named one by one, and every one passes `refusal(for:)` —
//     inside the home directory, never `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, the keychain
//     files, a `Moe-backup-*`, or the OTHER identity's home — at plan time
//     AND again at the moment of deletion;
//   * keychain items are an explicit allowlist of (service, account) pairs,
//     each with the file that creates it, and a test fails when the code
//     grows a service name that is in neither the allowlist nor the
//     not-ours list (Tests/MoeEraseTests/KeychainAllowlistGuardTests.swift);
//   * launchd jobs are an explicit list of labels, never a `com.moe.` prefix
//     — `com.moe.worktree-snapshot` is a developer's safety net and matches
//     that prefix;
//   * the scope is the bundle identifier. Moe Dev erases Moe Dev. Two things
//     on disk are NOT scoped by identifier and are shared by both builds —
//     `~/.hermes` (HermesSeed.destination) and the keychain service names
//     (`moe-child-oauth` and the rest) — so those belong to the release
//     identity and a Moe Dev erase leaves them, and says so;
//   * one thing outside `~` may go, and only for Moe: CuaDriver, the tool Moe
//     uses to work the screen (`MacEraseCuaDriver`, the owner's decision of
//     2026-09-11 — Moe installed it, and a person would not have it
//     otherwise). Exactly `<Applications>/CuaDriver.app`, a real folder and
//     not a link, whose Info.plist says `com.trycua.driver` — read when the
//     plan is made and again just before removal. Moe Dev never removes it:
//     like `~/.hermes`, it is shared with Moe.
//
// Nothing here reaches the real machine on its own: the home directory, the
// Applications folder, the keychain, launchctl, tccutil, defaults, the file
// removals and the relaunch are all handed in.
// `Sources/Moe/MacErase.swift` is the only place the real ones are chosen.
