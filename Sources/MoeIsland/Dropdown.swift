///
/// What it replaces. A spoken turn used to swap the open panel twice: the
/// conversation, then a one-line working row with seven controls, then the
/// conversation again with a different set. Mute moved between four rows,
/// Stop became a ✕ that called a weaker stop, and a slashed mic meant "you
/// are muted" while a slashed speaker meant "press to go quiet". The owner's
/// words: "that whole thing is a mess", and "I like extreme minimalism while
/// being clear, and the user not having to guess what's going on".
///
/// What it is now, for every state outside a meeting, one layout that is
/// never swapped mid-turn:
///
/// 1. one word of status in the black band beside the notch, with a clock
///    while Moe works (`IslandStatus`);
/// 2. your last words, in a bubble on the right, as in any chat;
/// 3. Moe's line: the step it is on, or the answer;
/// 4. a ⋯ that slides out the controls as small icons (`IslandTray`), with
///    the red muted mic kept outside it while muted, so mute stays
///    unmistakable;
/// 5. the field, only when you can use it (`Dropdown.showsField`).
///
/// The rules live here, in a library target, so they can be tested without
/// AppKit, and so the view and the height arithmetic read the same answer.
