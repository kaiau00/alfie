/// went up; the job's watchdog killed the job ten minutes later; the
/// connector's subprocess timeout killed only `whatsapp.sh`; and the card,
/// which had no idea any of that had happened, sat in front of the owner's
/// chat for ninety minutes asking about a send that nothing was waiting for
/// any more. A Send on it would have been answered to nobody.
///
/// So a card now knows three things about its own life, and leaves on any of
/// them with `exitWithdrawn` — a status that is neither Send nor Cancel:
///
/// * **Its requesters.** The process ids `confirm.sh` hands it (the caller
///   that ran `confirm.sh`, and the plugin process that ran the connector).
///   When one of them is gone, nobody is waiting on the answer.
/// * **Its parent.** When `confirm.sh` itself is killed — a SIGKILL runs no
///   trap — the card is re-parented to launchd, and that is the same news.
/// * **Its deadline.** An absolute time, never more than `longestWait` away,
///   whatever it was asked for. A card nobody has answered in an hour is a
///   card nobody is going to answer.
