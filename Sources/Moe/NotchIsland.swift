/// Moe's island: invisible at rest behind the notch, drops down on hover.
///
/// Written directly against AppKit rather than pulled from a package, because
/// every notch library on GitHub uses SwiftUI macros (`@Entry`, `#Preview`)
/// whose plugins ship with full Xcode — and this app builds with just the
/// Command Line Tools.
///
/// Two things here are non-obvious and both were learned the hard way:
///
///  1. **The window never changes size.** It is created once at the largest
///     size the island will ever need and stays there; only the drawn content
///     grows and shrinks. Resizing a window on hover makes the cursor fall
///     outside it, which fires hover-exit, which shrinks it back, which fires
///     hover-enter — a flicker loop.
///  2. **Hit testing is clipped to what's drawn.** Because the window is
///     permanently large, without this it would swallow every click in a wide
///     band across the top of the screen, including the menu bar.
