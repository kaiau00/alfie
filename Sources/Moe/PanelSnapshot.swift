/// `Moe --panel-snapshot <dir>` — docs/PANEL-FINDINGS.md §9.
///
/// The panel had been called ugly twice, and both times it was written
/// **without anyone seeing it**: running Moe opens a microphone and needs a
/// real meeting, so "does this look right?" was an expensive enough question
/// that it never got asked. This makes it a cheap one.
///
/// `ImageRenderer` draws *the same views the app draws* — `IslandView`, at the
/// real point sizes `NotchIsland` gives it, hanging off a stand-in notch, over
/// a stand-in video call. The call matters: judging a dark panel against a
/// white page is how you get one that vanishes over a face.
///
/// **Nothing of the user's is touched.** No microphone, no meeting, no brain,
/// no window. `MOE_HOME` is repointed at a scratch directory before `Config`
/// is first read, and `hermesKey` is filled in so nothing goes looking in
/// `~/.hermes/.env`. The Conductor is constructed and posed (see
/// `Conductor.SnapshotState`) and never started.
///
/// Two accommodations, both `ImageRenderer` facts rather than design opinions,
/// both in IslandSnapshotSeam.swift: a `TextField` rasterises as a blank hole,
/// so a snapshot draws its own text in the same box; and a macOS `ScrollView`
/// rasterises empty, so a snapshot lays the same rows over a `Color.clear`
/// which claims height the same way the real one does.
