/// An 8 MB Whisper-tiny encoder with a linear head, fed the last eight
/// seconds of the turn when the VAD reports silence. About 35 ms on an M3
/// for the inference and a couple for the features. Its verdict ends a
/// turn early when the thought is finished, and holds the door when it is
/// not ("send it to…"), which is the difference between a timer and a
/// listener.
///
/// Which file is loaded comes from `TurnModelCatalog` (today v3.2 alone,
/// fetched once into `<Moe home>/models/smart-turn`; `MOE_TURN_MODEL` pins
/// another for a bench). Without a model the machine's silence fallback
/// still ends every turn, just later.
