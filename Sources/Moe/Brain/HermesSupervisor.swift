/// Runs the Hermes gateway as a child of Moe, so the user never opens a
/// terminal, and keeps it running for as long as Moe is.
///
/// The gateway is the one process that holds the Claude sign-in for the
/// Hermes-owned Claude Code child (HERMES-PLAN.md, "Revised after review"),
/// which is what makes two rules here hard ones:
///
/// 1. **Only ever one gateway.** If a Hermes gateway already answers on the
///    port — at launch, on a restart, or because a second Moe won the race
///    to bind it — it is adopted, not duplicated: two gateways would be two
///    owners of the same credential, each refreshing it out from under the
///    other. An adopted gateway is not ours to restart or stop; if it stops
///    answering, the adopt-or-spawn decision is simply made again.
/// 2. **No orphan on quit.** `stop()` sends SIGTERM, waits five seconds, then
///    SIGKILLs the gateway's process group — but a crash or `kill -9` of Moe
///    never calls `stop()`. So the gateway is launched through a tiny bash
///    wrapper that holds the read end of a pipe from Moe; when Moe's side
///    closes for *any* reason, the wrapper TERMs the gateway's group and, five
///    seconds later, KILLs it (Hermes ignores SIGTERM while it drains a
///    turn). macOS has no `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG`; this is the portable
///    equivalent. A process we retire — a gateway that never answered — is
///    likewise TERM'd, then KILL'd, and its `Process` is kept until it has
///    actually exited.
///
/// What this cannot do: Hermes starts some helpers (browser, TTS, the MCP
/// watchdog) with `setsid`, in process groups of their own, and those can
/// outlive the gateway by Hermes's design. Moe has no handle on them.
///
/// Health = `GET /v1/models` with the bearer key. Only two answers count as
/// "a Hermes gateway is here": 200 with a JSON `data` array, or 401 with a
/// JSON `error` (the key is wrong, which HermesBrain explains). Anything else
/// on the port belongs to something that isn't Hermes, and the supervisor
/// says so rather than adopting or spawning on top of it.
///
/// Crash supervision: an exit we didn't ask for is restarted with backoff
/// (1, 2, 4… seconds, capped at 30), at most five times in ten minutes;
/// a gateway that stays healthy for a minute clears the count. After that
/// the supervisor says so once and keeps trying **silently**, once a minute
/// with a fresh window, until something answers; `start()` (New
/// Conversation) tries at once. Our own `stop()` is told apart from a crash
/// by process identity, as the old `claude -p` adapter did.
///
/// One exit is not a crash: Hermes refusing to start because its pid file
/// names a live process. Moe checks the *port* and Hermes checks its *lock*,
/// and a gateway started by hand can hold the second without the first. Then
/// the refusal is read off stderr and answered — adopt what answers on the
/// port, else spawn once more with Hermes's own `--replace` (§handleExitLocked).
///
/// A note on the credential: the setup-token goes into the gateway's
/// environment, and Hermes deliberately hands its whole environment to every
/// shell command the model runs (`tools/environments/local.py`). So the token
/// is visible to anything the model executes. Containment is the Claude Code
/// deny list and Hermes's terminal policy — not environment hygiene here.
///
/// Screen Recording and Accessibility (the model's eyes and hands — Hermes's
/// `computer_use` tool, which runs `screencapture` and posts CGEvents from
/// the hermes-tools MCP server, a Python child of the `claude` CLI, itself a
/// child of the gateway spawned here): TCC attributes both to the
/// *responsible process*, and for everything under this `Process()` chain —
/// Memoe.app → /bin/bash wrapper → hermes → claude → python → screencapture —
/// that is Memoe.app, because nothing in the chain goes through launchd or
/// `setsid` (the wrapper uses `set -m` job control, which changes the process
/// group but not TCC responsibility). So the prompts the user sees are for
/// **Moe**: "Moe would like to record this computer's screen" the first time
/// a screenshot is taken (it fails with "could not create image" until
/// granted — macOS shows the prompt once, then it is a Settings toggle), and
/// Accessibility for the first synthetic click/keystroke, which Moe already
/// holds for push-to-talk. If the gateway is ever launched by launchd or
/// through `open`, responsibility moves to that launcher and the toggles
/// would have to be granted to it instead. Deep links: `x-apple.systempreferences:
/// com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_ScreenCapture` and
/// `…?Privacy_Accessibility`.
/// TODO(Settings/BrainSettings.swift): a status row showing whether Moe has
/// Screen Recording (`CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess()`) and Accessibility
