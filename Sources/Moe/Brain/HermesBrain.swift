/// A locally running Hermes Agent gateway, spoken to over HTTP.
///
/// Hermes's `api_server` platform serves an OpenAI-style
/// `POST /v1/chat/completions` on 127.0.0.1. Nothing is spawned here — the
/// gateway is either already up (`hermes gateway run`) or brought up by a
/// `HermesSupervisor` handed in at init, which `start()` waits on before
/// probing. What this class owns is the SSE stream and the mapping of
/// Hermes's frames onto `BrainEvent`.
///
/// The on-the-wire shapes below are from `gateway/platforms/api_server.py`
/// (Hermes v0.20.6), not from a generic OpenAI client:
///
///     data: {"choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"role":"assistant"},"finish_reason":null}],…}
///     data: {"choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":"Hi"},"finish_reason":null}],…}
///     event: hermes.tool.progress
///     data: {"tool":"web_search","emoji":"🔍","label":"…","toolCallId":"…","status":"running"}
///     : keepalive                                   (every 30s of silence)
///     data: {"choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{…}}
///     data: [DONE]
///
/// A failed turn ends with `finish_reason: "error"` (or `"length"`) and an
/// `error.message` on that same chunk. HTTP-level failures are a JSON body
/// `{"error":{"message":…,"type":…,"code":…}}` with a 4xx/5xx status.
///
/// Session continuity is the `X-Hermes-Session-Id` header: one UUID per
/// conversation, rotated on reset, and Hermes reloads the transcript from its
/// own state.db — so each request carries only the system prompt and the new
/// user turn. Hermes only honours that header (and `X-Hermes-Session-Key`)
/// when the request is authenticated, which is why a key matters.
///
/// The system prompt goes with every turn, not just the first: Hermes applies
/// a request's system message as an *ephemeral* prompt layered over its own
/// core prompt and never stores it with the session, so a turn sent without
/// one would lose Moe's voice rules. That ephemerality is also why the live
/// brief belongs there and nowhere else — a brief prefixed to the user turn
/// would be persisted with the transcript, and N turns would carry N stale
/// briefs. Instead the prompt is rebuilt whenever `_brief.md` changes on
/// disk (a stat per turn), so it is always fresh and never stored.
///
/// **Threading contract:** every stored property is confined to `queue`. All
/// public methods hop onto it; URLSession delivers its callbacks onto it too
/// (its delegate queue is backed by `queue`). Events go out on the main queue.
