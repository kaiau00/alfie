// The app's one door to Memoe's cloud.
//
// This repository's open half is the local-only Mac app. Everything that
// talks to our cloud — the account and sign-in, the sync, Away and its
// hand-off, the plan, tickets and problem reports, the usage beacon, the
// cloud-minted voice — is closed, lives outside `Sources/`, and is compiled
// in only by the official build (`MOE_CLOUD`). It reaches the app through the
// protocol below and nothing else, and it plugs itself in once, at launch,
// from `Cloud.install()`.
//
// A build without it gets `LocalOnly`: every hook does nothing, every page
// and row that only means something with an account is not drawn, and the
// plan is "free". Nothing is hidden behind a switch a person could find; it
// is simply not in the program.
