// In-app Claude sign-in for the brain.
//
// The Hermes gateway's Claude Code child signs in with a long-lived
// setup-token (HERMES-PLAN.md, "Revised after review"). scripts/hermes-signin.sh
// is the reference for how that token is obtained and stored; this file is
// the same contract without a Terminal:
//
//   1. run `claude setup-token` under a pseudo-terminal (it refuses a pipe),
//   2. open the https URL it prints (claude.ai / anthropic.com only), in the
//      default browser,
//   3. the CLI asks for a code ("Paste code here if prompted >"): the sheet
//      shows a field, the user pastes what the browser page showed, and it
//      is typed into the CLI. Some versions get the code back on their own
//      and never ask; then the field never appears.
//   4. capture the `sk-ant-oat01-…` token from its output (ANSI stripped),
//   5. store it with /usr/bin/security as service `moe-child-oauth`,
//      account `moe`, access list = the security tool only — delete, then
//      add, never `-U` (see the script for why),
//   6. run configure-hermes.py and restart the gateway.
//
// Steps 5 and 6 are **this Mac's** destination, and since the Away brain
// sheet started using this flow they are one of two: `Destination.elsewhere`
// hands the captured token to a caller and writes nothing here — no keychain
// item, no ~/.hermes, no gateway restart. See `AwayBrainSetup.signInDestination`
// for why the away machine gets a token of its own rather than a copy of this
// one. Steps 1–4 — the pty, the host allowlist, the ANSI stripping, the
// length floor, the 401 check — are the same code for both, on purpose: a
// second copy of them is a second place for a guard to go missing.
//
// The token never reaches a log, a file, or the UI; the transcript that
// carried it is dropped the moment it is captured. Debug builds honour the
// same hooks the supervisor's tests use: MOE_SECURITY_BIN (a stub keychain)
// and MOE_CHILD_TOKEN_SERVICE (a test item name), plus MOE_CLAUDE_BIN (the
// fake CLI — required in `--signin-test`, so a test can never reach the
// real one).
