// What Moe says about each way of giving it something to think with, written
// once and read by both the onboarding screen and the Brain pane.
//
// The failure this file exists to prevent: onboarding used to say "Sign in
// with your Claude account" as though that were the only way. It is one of
// eleven (BrainProviderKind), across four ways of paying
// (BrainProviderKind.Access). A person who already pays for ChatGPT, or who
// has a key, or who wants nothing to leave the Mac, was told none of that.
//
// Rules this file keeps, and scripts/test-onboarding.sh enforces:
//
//   * every case of BrainProviderKind has an entry — the switch in
//     `guide(for:)` is exhaustive, so a twelfth provider will not compile
//     until someone writes its words;
//   * no entry may be empty, and every one ends in a `nextStep` — the single
//     next thing the person does, not a description of a state;
//   * `whatItIs` never assumes the reader knows what a subscription plan, an
//     API key or a local model is. One line each, no jargon;
//   * `tradeOff` is only ever a real difference, taken from what the
//     capability table actually knows (BrainCapabilityTable.lookup on the
//     provider's own defaultModel), never a guess.
