/// The onboarding was rewritten twice without anyone looking at it, because
/// seeing it meant a fresh ~/.moe and a launch. This is the same idea as
/// `PanelSnapshot`: `ImageRenderer` draws the real `OnboardingView` at the
/// real window size, posed (`OnboardingView.Pose`) rather than asked, so no
/// permission is touched and nothing is installed.
///
/// **Nothing of the user's is touched.** `MOE_HOME` and `HERMES_HOME` are
/// repointed at a scratch directory before `Config` is first read, the
/// Conductor is constructed and never started, and no window is opened.
///
/// scripts/test-onboarding.sh runs this and fails if any screen does not
/// render — a crash in a view body is otherwise only found on somebody
/// else's first launch.
