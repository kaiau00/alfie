// Everything Moe knows how to say about a macOS permission, written once.
//
// PRODUCT.md §8.4 binds this file: ask for one permission at a time, always
// with a stated reason, deep-link to the exact pane, and never block on a
// missing one. That only holds together if the reason is written in one
// place and reused — otherwise onboarding, Settings › Permissions and a
// Connections row waiting on a grant each invent their own words, and two of
// the three are wrong.
//
// Every entry answers the four questions a person actually has, and none may
// be left empty (scripts/test-connections-ui.sh checks all four):
//
//   what        — what Moe does with it, in human words
//   ifDeclined  — what happens if they say no. Always: Moe keeps working.
//   steps       — the exact click path, written out
//   settings    — the deep link that opens that exact pane
//
// plus `needsRelaunch`, because macOS reads some grants only at launch and a
// person who is not told that concludes the permission did not work.
