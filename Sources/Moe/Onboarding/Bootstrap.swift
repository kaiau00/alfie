/// got an app that dictated fine and answered nothing, and the only thing it
/// said about that was *"Moe couldn't start the part of itself that thinks.
/// Quit Memoe and open it again; if it keeps happening, reinstall Memoe"* — advice
/// that could not possibly work, because reinstalling did not include the part
/// that was missing.
///
/// The app now carries `install-hermes.sh` in its own payload (`Payload`), so
/// it can do this itself. This is the check and the fix, in one place, so that
/// onboarding and Settings › Brain give the same answer.
