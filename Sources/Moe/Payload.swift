/// / `learn.sh` / `nudge.sh`, the connect scripts the Connections pane launches
/// by path, and the starter vocabulary. `build.sh` stages all of it at
/// `Contents/Resources/moe-home`, mirroring `~/.moe` one directory for one, so
/// this is a plain recursive copy with no name list of its own to drift.
///
/// **Why a copy rather than running from the bundle.** Three reasons, each on
/// its own sufficient: `connectors/` holds credentials beside its own code
/// (`gmail-accounts.json`, `telegram.session`, `drive-docs-files.json`) and a
/// read-only directory breaks every connect flow; `gmail.py` and `telegram.py`
/// locate `confirm.sh` as `realpath(__file__)/../tools/confirm.sh` and their
/// comments deliberately refuse `$MOE_HOME`, so `tools/` must stay a sibling of
/// `connectors/`; and nothing may be written or `chmod`'d inside a signed
/// bundle without breaking the seal that Gatekeeper checks.
///
/// Before this existed the payload reached a Mac only through
/// `scripts/install.sh`, which copies it out of a git checkout of a private
/// repo — so a downloaded Moe had an empty Connections pane and a Brain pane
/// that could not choose a provider, and said nothing about why. docs/BUNDLE.md.
