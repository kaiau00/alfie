/// diagnosed it without checking what binary had written the log: one blamed
/// a guard in the Conductor, the other blamed a rule in `InstantAck`. Both
/// were wrong. The build running at the time simply did not contain
/// `InstantAck` — `install.sh` had run `./build.sh >/dev/null`, and the only
/// place the missing piece announced itself was that discarded stdout.
///
/// A log is written by a binary, and a binary is not the working tree. So
/// rather than assert what is compiled in, this **runs** each thing and

///
/// Exits non-zero when a model the app expects to carry is not there, so
