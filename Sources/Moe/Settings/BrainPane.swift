// Settings › Brain, as three things a person can see at once: whose
// account Moe is borrowing, which model, and how hard it thinks.
//
// What changed from the pane this replaces, and why:
//
//   * Model and thinking effort were folded under "Advanced", so the two
//     settings people most wanted to change were the two they could not
//     find. They are the page now, as rows of chips with every option in
//     view and two words under each saying what picking it gets you.
//   * The words on the chips are the provider's own — `claude-opus-4-8`,
//     `xhigh` — never a Moe-invented scale. A person on ChatGPT sees the
//     levels ChatGPT has; a person on Claude sees Claude's. See
//     BrainProviderKind.effortLevels(for:).
//   * There is no Apply. Tapping a chip saves it, tells Hermes, and checks
//     that Moe still answers; the card at the top says what happened. An
//     Apply button that sat two screens below the thing it applied was how
//     a change could be made and never take.
//   * Everything that needs a field — a key, an address, a sign-in — is in
//     one sheet behind "Change account…", so the page itself never shows a
//     text field. The sheet lists every provider Hermes offers, in three
//     plain groups, each row ending in its one next step.
//   * "Hermes" is not said anywhere on this pane or its sheet.
