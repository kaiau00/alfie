/// The whole answer comes from `hermes/reminders.py`, which is the pane's
/// side of Hermes's cron: the schedule store, the sixteen blueprints, and
/// the one route by which a Moe job may be created. Nothing here parses
/// `hermes cron list` — that command prints a box-drawn report with no
/// `--json` at all — and nothing here writes `cron/jobs.json`.
///
/// Read the head of that script before changing anything here. The two
/// rules it enforces are not cosmetic: a job created any way other than
/// `register_job` → `pin_job_brain` stops the next time the person changes
/// their brain in Settings, and a blueprint default accepted as an answer
/// is a reminder nobody asked for.
///
/// `JobActivity` is the other half and stays the other half. It owns last
/// run, next run, outcome and cost, from `hermes-jobs/job-activity.py`;
/// this owns where a job delivers, what it was asked to do, and whether it
/// can fire. The pane reads both and joins them on `id`.
///
/// Everything here blocks on a subprocess. Call it off the main thread.

    //
    // That is not defensiveness for its own sake. Swift's synthesised
    // `Decodable` does **not** fall back to a property's default value for
    // a missing key — it throws `keyNotFound`, and the whole answer
    // becomes nil. Measured here on 2026-09-04: adding one `var error =
    // ""` to `Listing` made every successful `list` fail to decode,
    // because a success has no error to report, and the pane went from a
    // list of reminders to "Moe couldn't reach the part of itself that
    // keeps the clock". `Outcome` had the same hole and would have
    // reported every created reminder as a failure *after* creating it.
    //
    // `reminders.py` also fills every key on every path (its `SHAPES`), so
    // this is the second of two halves. One would do today; two is what
    // survives either end changing.
