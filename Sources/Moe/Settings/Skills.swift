/// What Moe knows how to do, and the one key that turns a piece of it off.
///
/// A skill is a page of instructions Hermes hands the model when the job
/// looks like the one the page describes — how to read a PDF, how to work
/// a GitHub pull request, how to talk to Obsidian. There are 96 of them on
/// this Mac. The model does not run them; it reads them, and then does
/// what they say with the tools it already has.
///
/// **Source:** `skills-catalogue.py`, which reads the five stores
/// `hermes skills list` reads and answers in JSON — that command prints a
/// rich table with no `--json` and truncates every name past twenty
/// characters, so the one thing a pane needs from it (a name it can write
/// back) is the one thing it will not give.
///
/// **It writes `skills.disabled` and nothing else** (HERMES-SURFACES §4.5).
/// That key already travels between the Mac and the machine as a sealed
/// `document` record, so this pane is cross-device on the day it ships and
/// must not invent a second mechanism. The write is a surgical text edit
/// verified by re-parsing — `config.yaml` opens with twenty lines of
/// comment that a `safe_load` → `safe_dump` round-trip deletes without a
/// word.
///
/// **Curation is a security property, not a nicety.** A skill that tells
/// the model to run a command this Mac does not have is worse than an
/// absent skill: the model reads the page, runs `memo`, gets `command not
/// found`, and has spent the turn finding out. Hermes does not check —
/// `tools/skills_tool.py` builds its answer with `"required_commands": []`
/// and `"missing_required_commands": []` hard-coded — so this does, and
/// the number is bigger than §4.5's four: **eleven** of the fourteen
/// skills declaring a command are missing it on this Mac, and seven of
/// those eleven are switched on.
///
/// Everything here blocks on a subprocess. Call it off the main thread.
