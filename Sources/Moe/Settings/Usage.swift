/// table — every column one `agent/insights.py` already reads. `hermes
/// insights` computes the same numbers, prints them in a box-drawing table
/// with no `--json`, and takes several seconds doing charts nobody asked
/// for.
///
/// Four things measured on this Mac on 2026-09-04, each of which changes
/// what an honest screen can say.
///
/// **"Total tokens" is not what you and Moe wrote.** Thirty days here:
/// 1.6M input and 900k output against 194M of cache read. `hermes
/// insights` adds all four and prints "Total tokens: 216,847,032", which
/// reads like a bill and is almost entirely the same context arriving
/// again on every turn. The two are kept apart here and never summed.
///
/// **Almost none of it is metered, and that is recorded rather than
/// guessed.** 708 of 776 sessions carry `cost_status = "included"` against
/// `claude-code-subscription`: the Claude plan paid for them, per turn,
/// already. 32 carry `"estimated"` against DeepSeek and hold the only real
/// money on this Mac — 56 cents. 36 carry no status and have zero tokens,
/// which is a session that never took a turn, not a cost nobody knows.
///
/// **§4.4's own worry is fixed and this file says so.** It says the
/// auxiliary lanes are all `auto`, so title generation records `$0.00`
/// against an "unknown" billing route. Measured now: those lanes are named
/// (`deepseek-v4-pro`, `deepseek-v4-flash`), their provider is `deepseek`,
/// their status is `estimated`, and they are where the dollars are. The §6
/// config audit closed it.
///
/// **Cost per tool cannot be computed.** §4.4 asks for "which tools cost
/// most". Hermes attributes tokens to a session and to nothing smaller —
/// there is no per-tool token column anywhere in `state.db` — so what
/// comes back is how often each tool ran, under a key called `calls`, and
/// the pane says which of the two it is showing.
