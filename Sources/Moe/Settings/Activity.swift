/// What Moe has actually been doing, on this Mac.
///
/// Four sources, joined into one list in time order (HERMES-SURFACES §4.2):
///
/// - **the ledger**, for the conversations you had — the only one of the
///   four that is Moe's own and the only one with words in it;
/// - **`~/.moe/logs/activity.jsonl`**, for turns that happened somewhere
///   else entirely. That file is the only way Moe learns a turn happened
///   on Telegram: those never reach the app, never reach its ledger from
///   this machine, and the first anyone hears of one is the reply on the
///   phone;
/// - **Hermes's cron run ledger**, for what ran on a clock;
/// - **Hermes's failure incidents**, for what did not.
///
/// Three things this file will not do, each of them a rule rather than a
/// preference.
///
/// **No message bodies.** The activity hook records a timestamp, a
/// platform, a chat type, a session id, a model and two character counts,
/// and it says in its own header why: it would otherwise hold both sides
/// of every conversation on every platform and be the best prize in
/// `~/.moe`. The timeline says what happened; the words are reached by
/// opening that conversation in Chats, under the person's own key.
///
/// **No completeness claim built on `gateway.log`.** Verified by the
/// cloud session: `Plugin discovery complete` is logged by
/// `hermes_cli.plugins`, which that file's component filter excludes, and
/// `Loaded hook '<name>'` is a bare `print()` reaching no file at all. A
/// health check built on the first of those cried wolf on a healthy
/// machine. The log is shown as a log and described as an incomplete one.
///
/// **This Mac only.** Moe Away runs on a Fly volume and its logs stay
/// there; nothing here can read them, and a timeline that implied
/// otherwise would be read as "Moe did nothing away" rather than "Moe
/// cannot see what it did away".
///
/// Everything here blocks. Call it off the main thread.
