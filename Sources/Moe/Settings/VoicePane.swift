// Settings › Voice — one page for how you talk to Moe and how it answers.
//
// Until 2026-09-25 this was three screens: Voice › Talking to Moe (seventeen
// rows, three of them about the screen rather than the voice), Voice › How
// Moe sounds (the engine and the voice as two choices), and Settings ›
// Replies (eleven more). The owner's word for it was "overstimulating", and
// the design he picked (D, ~/moe-voice-notes/voice-settings-proposal.md) is
// this: three short sections of independent, plainly named choices, each
// main switch opening its own one or two controls when it is on, and the
// rarely touched rest behind one "More". Nothing was dropped — every
// person-facing option is on the page or under More; the screen rows moved
// to Settings › Permissions. `VoiceSettingsModel` holds the bindings and the
// reveal rules, and is what the tests drive.
