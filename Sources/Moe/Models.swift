/// The speech and voice models, and how they get onto a stranger's Mac.
///
/// Moe's recognition and its voice are Core ML models that FluidAudio fetches
/// from Hugging Face into two cache directories (see `Root`).
/// Left to itself that is **889 MB downloaded before Moe can answer once**,
/// behind a status line that says "loading speech recognition…" with no
/// percentage — and nothing at all on a Mac that is offline. docs/BUNDLE.md §2.
///
/// So a release carries them. `scripts/fetch-models.sh` stages them into the
/// repo's gitignored `Models/`, `build.sh` copies that into
/// `Contents/Resources/Models/<repo folder>`, and this links each cache
/// directory at the bundle on first run.
///
/// **Links, not copies.** A copy would put ~900 MB on the disk twice, once in
/// the app and once in the cache. A symlink costs nothing, and the
/// models are read-only anyway: they ship pre-compiled as `.mlmodelc`, so
/// nothing needs to write into them. What a link *cannot* survive is the app
/// moving or being deleted, so every launch checks that each link still points
/// at this bundle and repoints it when it does not.
///
/// **A real directory always wins.** If a model is already downloaded — every
/// Mac that ran Moe before this existed has them — that directory is left
/// exactly as it is. This only ever creates a link where there was nothing,
/// or repairs a link it made itself.
