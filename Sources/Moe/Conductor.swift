    // so that timer is gone — and with it its race with the session's own
    // health tick over one meter. `MeetingSession` is the only drainer now,
    // and the levels it reads go to the log every 15 s.
    //
    // What that race actually was, because the first version of this
    // comment said it halved the audio each drainer saw and that is wrong.
    // `LevelMeter.drain` accumulates and resets: every sample went to
    // exactly one drain and none was lost. What the second drainer took
    // away was any relationship between a reading and a *known* interval —
    // the health tick's one-second window became whatever was left since
    // the ring's last 100 ms drain.

    // It is also the wrong direction to explain "mic silent". The ring's
    // timer called `health.observe` too, so health got eleven readings a
    // second instead of one, each over a shorter window — and a shorter
    // window is louder, because it averages a 100 ms word into less
    // silence. `observe` only ever records that a channel sounded; it never
    // takes it back. More readings, each louder, can only have made the
    // health check *more* likely to see sound. The reason a meeting looked
    // healthy while its windows were being thrown away is the speech gate,
