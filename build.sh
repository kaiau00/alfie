# ── Which Moe is this: the one the person uses, or one we are working on ──
#
# On 2026-09-03 the same Mac's Moe was replaced three times in one day by
# three different mechanisms: an install from a branch behind main, an
# install that overrode the staleness guard, and — the one that actually
# confused the person for twenty minutes — a build launched straight out of
# a worktree's `dist/`, never installed at all. Every guard written that day
# watches the install path, and the last of those never went near it.
#
# The fix is not a better guard. On macOS an app's identity is its
# CFBundleIdentifier: Launch Services treats two bundles with the same one
# as the same app, sharing its preferences, its container, its privacy
# grants and its URL claims. Chrome Canary is com.google.Chrome.canary with
# its own data directory and its own icon; Firefox Nightly, VS Code
# Insiders and Tauri's debugApplicationIdSuffix are all the same shape. A
# development build that cannot occupy the release app's slot cannot take
# it, whoever runs what, and is obvious on screen when it is running.
#
# MOE_DEV=1 (or a `dev` argument) builds that: a different identity, a
# different name, a different home, no updater. Everything else about the
# build is identical, so what is tested is what ships.
# ── Which edition: official Memoe, or a community build of the open source ──
#
# The official identity — bundle id, URL scheme, Sparkle feed and key, the
# hosted edge, and the strictness a release needs — lives in ONE closed file,
# cloud/release.env, which the public export does not carry. Present (this
# private repo), it is sourced and every build is exactly what it was before
# the file existed. Absent (a fresh clone of the public repo), the build is a
# community build: its own bundle id, its own home, no updater, no cloud, and
# models downloaded on first use instead of refused. MOE_EDITION=community
# builds that here too, which is how scripts/test-editions.sh checks it.
#
# Presence rather than a flag a caller must remember: ship.sh, release.sh,
# install.sh and catch-up.sh all reach this line, and none of them can forget
# to say "official" — a stale copy passes through here anyway (CLAUDE.md,

# scripts the Connections pane launches by path, and the starter vocabulary.
#
# Until 2026-08-31 all of it reached a Mac only through scripts/install.sh,
# which copies it out of a **git checkout of a private repo**. Someone who
# downloaded the dmg got an app with an empty Connections pane and a Brain
# pane that could not choose a provider, and nothing said why: the fallback in
# ConnectionsModel.swift to ~/moe/... always hits on a developer's Mac and can
# never hit on anyone else's. docs/BUNDLE.md §1.
#
# The tree here mirrors ~/.moe one for one, so the installer that lays it down
# (FirstRun.installPayloadIfNeeded) is a plain recursive copy with no name list
# of its own to drift out of date. It is staged under Contents/Resources, i.e.
# inside the code signature, so what lands in ~/.moe is what we signed.
#
# It is a *seed*, not the live copy: the app copies it out on first run rather
# than running from inside the bundle. connectors/ holds credentials beside its
# own code (gmail-accounts.json, telegram.session, drive-docs-files.json),
# tools/ must stay a sibling of connectors/ because gmail.py locates

# of Core ML weights do not belong in a git history), and this copies them in.
#

# perfectly good build that simply downloads on demand, which is what every
# development build should do rather than carry a gigabyte around. release.sh
# is where their absence is worth saying out loud.

# (tools/: Python 3.14, Node, npm, uv, ffmpeg, ripgrep, the browser) by
# `pm.prepare_tools` — never from anybody's ~/.hermes, and rewrites every
# absolute path to @HERMES_ROOT@, which HermesSeed.swift substitutes back on
# first run.

PLIST

# The plist is generated, so a mistake in the heredoc is a mistake in every
# build. This one shipped: the "Moe 0.3.10 (build 17)" bump clipped the
# opening `<!--` off the MoeCommit comment, leaving prose between two keys,
# and the only symptom was an error from codesign 350 seconds of compiling
# later — `Encountered unexpected character o on line 13`. A bare
# `plutil -lint … >/dev/null` was already here and `set -e` did stop the
# build, correctly; what it did not do is say that build.sh had generated the
# file, so the failure read as a corrupt bundle rather than a typo twelve
# lines up. Same check, a message that names its own cause.

# Sign it. Which identity, in what order, and why the order is the
# difference between a consent key that survives a rebuild and one that is
# re-minted (with a Google sign-in) after every catch-up: scripts/sign-build.sh.
#
# Local builds prefer our Developer ID (team 5Y8C3ZR5X6), then the self-signed
# "Moe Code Signing", then ad-hoc. A published build keeps its old order;
# release.sh re-signs it with the Developer ID, hardened and notarized.
#
# The certificate is not the unrotatable thing: Sparkle's SUUpdateValidator
# returns YES on `passedDSACheck || passedCodeSigning`, deliberately, "because
# this allows key rotation without breaking chain of trust". The EdDSA key is
# what may never change; the certificate may.
# A checkout in an iCloud-synced folder (Desktop or Documents with iCloud
# Drive on) copies its Finder info and file-provider tags into the bundle,
# and codesign refuses them as "resource fork, Finder information, or similar
# detritus". Some bundled resources are read-only, and xattr needs write
# access to clear them.
