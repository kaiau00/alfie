/// Background helpers the owner started on 2026-09-29 vanished three ways,
/// each driven here through the real Conductor:
///
/// 1. Seven helpers finished at 16:30 and their result sat in the inbox all
///    day behind an unanswered nudge on the island — every inbox file waited
///    for `pendingNudge == nil`.
/// 2. At 20:33 a sign-in to another Claude account rebuilt the brain, which
///    cleared the chat and started a new brain on a random session: the next
///    question went to a conversation that had never started any helpers.
/// 3. A result names no conversation, so it could only ever be answered in
///    whichever one happened to be on screen.
