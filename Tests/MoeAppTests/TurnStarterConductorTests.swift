/// Who started each turn the Conductor sends, driven through the real
/// Conductor: every path below is the one the app takes (the voice engine's
/// own callbacks, the nudge buttons, a brain restart, a relaunch pickup, a
/// meeting ending), and the stand-in brain records the `TurnStarter` each
/// send carried. `HermesBrain` turns that into `X-Hermes-Turn-Origin`;
/// scripts/test-turn-origin.sh proves that half against a fake gateway.
///
/// Why it matters: Hermes lets its Chrome lane act in the person's own
/// Chrome only on a `.person` turn. A background send marked `.person` is a
/// transcript, a subagent's result or a note written half an hour after a
/// crash, opening tabs in front of whoever is — or is not — at the Mac.
