# Integration test for meeting mode's file pipeline, driven through
# `.build/debug/Moe --meeting-test <dir> <out>` against scripts/fake-hermes.
# No audio device is opened, nothing is played, and nothing of the user's
# is touched: MOE_HOME (debug-only) points Moe at a scratch config.json and
# log, and the fake gateway sits on a random free port — never 8642.
#
# The recording is the spike's 8 s pair (system.wav: two `say` voices, one
# agreeing to ship on Tuesday, one promising the notes; mic.wav: the room,
# nobody speaking). Set MOE_MEETING_FIXTURE to point at another pair.
#
#   1. timeline shape  → [mm:ss] them (speaker N): … lines, two speakers,
#                        the words that matter, nothing on "you"
#   2. notes           → summary.md + meeting.json from the fake's canned JSON;
#                        request carried session key moe-meeting, fenced transcript
#   2b. minute scan    → the live action-item pass (ActionItemScan) reaches the
#                        gateway with <new-lines>, and what it found is merged
#                        into the notes at the end, deduped against them
#   3. bad reply       → prose instead of JSON: transcript kept, no summary.md,
#                        meeting.json says why
#   4. no gateway      → connection refused: transcript kept, "brain unavailable"
#   5. disabled        → meetingSummarise=false: no request at all
#   6. captures        → MOE_MEETING_CAPTURES=1: a captioned screenshot and a
#                        clip land in meeting.json, in summary.md's Screens
#                        section, and the caption reaches the summary prompt
