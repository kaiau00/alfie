# Integration test for DictationPolisher, driven through
# `.build/debug/Moe --polish-test` against scripts/fake-hermes. Nothing real
# is started and nothing of the user's is touched: MOE_HOME (debug-only)
# points Moe at a scratch directory with its own config.json, vocabulary.txt
# and log, and the fake gateway sits on a random free port — never 8642, so
# a live Moe is neither talked to nor disturbed.
#
#   1. polished     → fake reply is pasted; request carried the dictation
#                     session headers, the fence, the vocabulary, the app hint
#   1b. context    → text before the cursor is fenced and labelled as data;
#                     absent when none is given
#   2. stable id    → a second run reuses the same X-Hermes-Session-Id
#   3. timeout      → reply slower than the budget: input returned, timing logged
#   4. disabled     → dictationPolish=false: no request made at all
#   5. refusal      → "I can't…" reply fails the guard: input returned
#   6. quotes/fence → wrapping the model adds is stripped
#   7. no gateway   → connection refused: input returned, fast
