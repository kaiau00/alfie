# Proves the app can populate ~/.moe on its own, from inside its own bundle,
# with no git checkout anywhere — which is the whole difference between what a
# stranger downloads and what a developer runs.
#
# It builds a staged app (no compiler), then compares the payload against the
# manifest in scripts/test-fresh-install.sh — the authoritative list of every
# file the app and the shell scripts read, and who reads each one. That test
# checks what scripts/install.sh puts in ~/.moe; this one checks that the
# bundle can put the same things there.
#
#   1. the payload is in the bundle       → staged by build.sh
#   2. it carries every required file     → against test-fresh-install.sh
#   3. it carries no user state           → no credentials, no memories
#   4. it carries no repo furniture       → no tests/, no .git, no docs
#   5. a fresh ~/.moe gets populated      → the copy, run for real
#   6. a second run changes nothing       → the stamp
#   7. user edits survive an update       → the never-overwrite rule
