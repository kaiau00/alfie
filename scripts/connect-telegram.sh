# Lets Moe READ your personal Telegram chats (separate from the bot).
#
# The bot can only see messages sent to the bot. To know what's happening in
# your actual conversations, Moe signs in as a second device on your own
# account using Telegram's official MTProto API (Telethon).
#
# Two ways to run it:
#
#   In a terminal: asks for api_id/api_hash (unless bundled, below), your
#   phone number, the code Telegram sends, and a 2FA password if you have one.
#
#   Driven by the app (MOE_CONNECT_NONINTERACTIVE=1): a conversation over
#   stdin/stdout, one `KEY=value` line per answer, and stdin STAYS OPEN across
#   the steps — the app keeps its write end of the pipe open until this
#   script exits, because Telegram only sends the code after the phone
#   number is known:
#
#     app → script   PHONE=+15551234567         (API_ID=/API_HASH= lines may
#                                               come before it; see below)
#     script → app   NEED=code                  Telegram has sent a code
#     app → script   CODE=12345
#     script → app   NEED=password              only if 2FA is on
#     app → script   PASSWORD=…
#     script → app   ✓ signed in as …           exit 0
#
#   A `✗ …` line and a non-zero exit at any point ends it; the last line on
#   stdout is the sentence to show. No secret is ever printed.
#
# api_id / api_hash. Telegram issues these per application at
# https://my.telegram.org/apps. The product ships its own pair — the app
# sets MOE_TELEGRAM_API_ID and MOE_TELEGRAM_API_HASH in the environment (or
# sends API_ID=/API_HASH= lines) so a user never sees that page. Without
# either, a terminal user is asked once; they are stored in
# ~/.moe/connectors/telegram.json (0600) for the connector.
#
# Redirection for tests: MOE_HOME; MOE_TELEGRAM_PYTHON = an interpreter that
# already has telethon (a fake one on PYTHONPATH), skipping the venv and the
# pip install. Bash 3.2 and `set -u` clean.

#
# Slice E3. The person's cloud computer cannot use this Mac's session (one
# session live in two places is AUTH_KEY_DUPLICATED, and Telegram logs BOTH
# out), so it signs in as a device of its own: it exports a login key — what
# a QR code would carry — and this Mac's signed-in session accepts it
# (`auth.acceptLoginToken`), exactly as a phone accepts a scanned QR. The app
# fetches the key from the machine and hands it here on stdin as a
# `KEY=<base64>` line — never argv, never the log — with an `ACCOUNT=<id>`
# line: the Telegram user id the ask to the machine named. This Mac checks
# its own session is that account before it accepts anything, so a key is
# never let into an account the ask was not for.
#
# This mode never starts a sign-in of its own: no send_code_request, no
# sign_in, and no password — a PASSWORD= line is not read. A Mac that is not
# signed in says so and stops, and a Mac with no session file is not given
# one. The key lives about thirty seconds, so the venv is used as it is and
# nothing is installed on the way.
