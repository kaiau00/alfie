# not write: ~1 GB of third-party runtime, built on the developer's Mac — the
# Mac whose ~/.hermes holds auth.json, mcp-tokens/, memories/ and sessions/.
# Two things therefore have to be true, and neither is provable by reading
# the script:
#
#   1. nothing personal reaches the seed, and the gate that says so would
#      actually fail if something did;
#   2. the seed runs after it is copied somewhere else, because every absolute
#      path in a venv points at the machine that built it.
#
# Tests 2 and 3 are the ones that matter: a privacy gate that has never been
# seen to fail is decoration, so both are checked by planting a leak and
# demanding a non-zero exit.

# stage-hermes-seed.sh builds a seed from a COMMIT of the fork: the code by
# `git archive`, the store and the venv by pm (network). The network half is
# replaced here by MOE_SEED_BUILDER, a script that lays down the same shape pm
# does — measured from a real 3.14 seed staged 2026-10-07 from upstream
# 354724fb08, not invented: the store entry is `python-<ver>+<date>-<target>`,
# the venv's pyvenv.cfg `home` names its bin, the console scripts are uv's
# relocatable trampolines, and the editable install's direct_url.json and
# finder name the build directory. Everything after the builder — pruning,
# linking, the stamp, the placeholder rewrite and the leak gate — is the real
# script running on it.
#
# The "interpreter" in the store is a shell script that execs this Mac's
# python3, so the stage's own `python write_install_stamp.py` step really runs.

# interpreter symlink into a 17.3 MB copy, and a python-build-standalone binary
# copied out of its prefix cannot find its own standard library: it falls back
# to the prefix compiled into it, `/install`, and dies on `import encodings`.
# Moe installed, laid the seed down, spawned the brain, and the brain could not
# start — the island said "the part of Moe that thinks kept stopping" and
# Connections fell back to the ten Mac connectors it can find without one.
#
# Every gate that seed passed asked about its shape: stamp, links, size,
# placeholder, the three parts by name. A working seed and a dead one are
# identical under all of them. So check-hermes-seed-runs.sh starts it instead.
