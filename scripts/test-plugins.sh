# The Python suites that sit beside Hermes's plugins, jobs and gateway hooks.
#
# These were written, they pass, and until 2026-09-04 nothing ran them: not
# test-all.sh, not CI, not the shell suite next door. Between them
# moe-ledger/ and claimstore/ are the memory and credential chain — the
# canonical record form, the sealed claim, the retired key, the projection
# into MEMORY.md, the drift a second writer must not cause — and they had
# been running nowhere at all. scripts/test-suites-are-run.sh is the guard
# that stops that happening again; this is the runner it points at.
#
#   moe-ledger            the ledger library and the memory provider
#   claimstore            the claim store plugin and its projection
#   moe-connectors        the connectors plugin and detached intents
#   moe-blueprints        the blueprints plugin against Hermes's catalog
#   moe-profile           the learning-profile plugin
#   hermes-gateway-hooks  the moe-activity hook: what it records and refuses
#   hermes-jobs           the away/intent/watch/autoread jobs
#   hermes/tests          migrate-memory (the configure-hermes merge tests are
#                         step 14 of scripts/test-configure-hermes.sh)
#   learn                 distil, merge, profile, consent, seed-memory
#   connectors            the gmail crawl parser and the telegram send gate
#
# The last two belong to scripts/test-learn.sh, which runs them first and then
# a long end-to-end half against a fake gateway. That end-to-end half fails on
# main today (25 of 136 checks), so test-learn.sh cannot be put in test-all.sh
# without turning it red for everyone — and if these unit tests only ran from
# there, they would not run at all. They are cheap and they pass, so they run
# here; scripts/test-suites-excused.txt records why the shell suite does not.
#
# moe-screen's main suite is not here: it is a stdlib unittest module that
# only runs as a script, and step 11 of test-configure-hermes.sh runs it that
# way. Its pytest file, test_pushes.py (slice E1: the gateway leaves the pull
# marker on a Mac), IS here — alone, and with --import-mode=importlib,
# because it is one more `tests/` directory with no __init__.py and pytest's
# default import mode would clash with the others' test module names.
#
# Nothing here touches the network, the real ~/.moe or the real ~/.hermes:
# every conftest points MOE_HOME and HERMES_HOME at a temp directory, and this
# script exports both at a scratch directory too, for the suites that have no
# conftest to do it.

# ── a note on the user's own Hermes and Moe ─────────────────────────────────
# Two things were tried here and are deliberately not done, because both were
# wrong in a way worth recording.
#
# Comparing ~/.hermes and the Moe home before and after, the way step 15 of
# test-configure-hermes.sh does, reports a failure every single time on this
# Mac: the live Moe writes to both while the suites run, and the check cannot
# tell its writes from theirs. A check that fires on unrelated noise is no
# better than one that cannot fire at all.
#
# Exporting MOE_HOME and HERMES_HOME at a scratch directory looks safer and
# breaks two tests that are meant to read the real thing —
# moe-connectors' RealCatalogue::test_it_registers_the_catalogue_not_a_curated_list
# and moe-ledger's test_the_published_shape_is_what_the_reader_parses read
# this machine's actual connector manifests on purpose, which is the point of
# them. Isolation of WRITES belongs to each conftest, and every one of them
# does it: an explicit temp MOE_HOME/HERMES_HOME per test.
