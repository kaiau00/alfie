#!/bin/bash
# The secret window (Sources/MoeConfirm/SecretMain.swift, contract in
# Sources/MoeDesign/SecretPrompt.swift): a person types a password or a
# sign-in code, and Hermes gets it as JSON on stdout — never argv, env or a
# log line.
#
# Out of the built binary, and never with a window: every launch below is
# `--describe` (prints and exits), `--wait-test` (the clock, the signals and
# the caller going away, no window) or a request that fails to parse. Checked:
#
#   * reached by NAME — `moe-secret`, what HERMES_SECRET_PROMPT_CMD points at,
#     with no arguments — as well as with --secret;
#   * a bad request answers {"ok":false,"reason":"invalid"}, exit 1;
#   * nobody answering answers "timeout", exit 1; SIGTERM and the caller
#     going away answer "cancelled", exit 1 — each ONE JSON object;
#   * nothing it writes to stderr carries the username it was handed;
#   * the send card is untouched: moe-confirm without --secret still speaks
#     the NUL-separated format.
#
# Needs a built MoeConfirm (`swift build --product MoeConfirm`). A missing
# binary FAILS rather than skipping.
