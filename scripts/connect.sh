# 2026-09-07 the ONLY writer of that file was sync.sh's ten-minute tick, so
# the ten minutes after a person connected something were the ten minutes in
# which Moe would tell them, in the local connector's own words, that "no

# they had just connected. Measured on the owner's Mac: connected 21:34,

# until 2026-09-11 that is where connecting LINE stopped: the row went green
# over a listener nothing would ever call.

# hands back a webhook URL; the edge then routes each message to whichever
# Moe is awake, this Mac included). channels.py register does exactly that —
# reads the token and secret just written to .env, registers them, and points
# LINE at the URL over LINE's own endpoint API — and it is what enrolment's
# `migrate` does for a LINE connected earlier. This calls it for a LINE
