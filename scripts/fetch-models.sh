# history, and they are reproducible from Hugging Face by this script.

# **Which files each model needs is not written down here.** The app itself
# warms every model through `Moe --fetch-models`, which runs the same load
# calls the product runs — so FluidAudio decides what to download, and this
# script only copies the result out of its caches. A hand-written file list
# would drift the first time a model gained a file, and the symptom would be
# an app that downloads "bundled" models anyway.

# app has run, Models.linkIfNeeded has replaced each cache directory with a
# **symlink into Memoe.app**. `-d` follows a symlink so the check passes, but
# BSD `cp -R` copies the link itself — so Models/ would fill up with links
# into dist/Alfie.app, build.sh would `rm -rf` that app, and the next release
# would ship a Models tree of dangling links. It would report a few kilobytes
# and say nothing, and the user would get the 806 MB first-run download the
# whole exercise exists to remove.

# Weight the app does not use. FluidAudio's PocketTTS cache accumulates every
# model set that has ever been asked for, and `pocket_state.mlmodelc` (163 MB)
# belongs to the `.aneState` placement — which Moe deliberately does not ship
# (TtsTuning.pocketPreferred, and it never loaded on the machine that tried
# it). Staged unpruned it would be 163 MB of an app nobody ever reads.
#
# The cache keeps its copy, so asking for `.aneState` with `--tts-ladder`
# still works; this only trims what goes inside Memoe.app.
# A model dropped from the lists above stays in Models/ forever otherwise, and
# gets copied into the app by build.sh. That is not hypothetical: Supertonic
# was removed from `CACHE_MODELS` and `Models.bundled`, `--check` reported
# "7 staged, 0 missing", and the next build still shipped 161 MB of it —
# because nothing here was looking for models that should no longer be there.
# A check that reports only what it went looking for is the mistake this repo
# keeps making, so this one names what it took away.
