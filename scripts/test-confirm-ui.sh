# This whole section is about ONE claim: the new branch can only ever refuse
# what the old code already refused. Before it existed, a runtime with no
# moe-confirm and no /usr/bin/osascript reached `$OSA` as a missing file, got
# an empty RESULT, and exited 1 — every time, for every message. So the bar
# each check below has to clear is not "does it approve when it should"; it is
# "is there any arrangement of files and answers that approves when a person
# did not".
#
# It cannot be reached on a Mac, which is the whole problem with testing it:
# /usr/bin/osascript is on every Mac. The seam is the same two-key,
# temp-directory-only arrangement as the other two in this file, and it
# ROUTES rather than approves — forced on, it reaches confirm-away.py, which
# still refuses without a $MOE_ASK_DIR somebody minted and refuses again
# without the exact word in it.
