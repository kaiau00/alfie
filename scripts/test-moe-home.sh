# This is the only change in the product that picks up a directory holding a

# else. The happy path is the least interesting part of it; what matters is
# every case where it must refuse:
#
#   * both homes exist        → merging them automatically loses notes
#   * ~/.moe is already a link → it ran before; do not run again
#   * ~/.moe is someone's own link somewhere else → not ours to redirect
#   * the move fails          → say so, never claim success
#
# And the shim the whole thing rests on: ~/.moe stays a working symlink, so
# the ~317 payload scripts that still spell the old path keep writing to the
# same directory. Without that, half a user's data would land in a second
# home nobody knows about.
