# Moe's eyes, end to end through Hermes — screenshot only.
#
# Runs Hermes's `computer_use` tool directly (no gateway, no Claude, no
# clicks, no typing) and then the same capture through the hermes-tools MCP
# server exactly as Claude Code would call it, checking that an MCP `image`
# block comes back, that it is ≤ 1568 px on its longest side, and that the
# text next to it carries the coordinate note.
#
#   1. unit tests  — the backend's scaling math and stubbed capture, plus the
#                    image-block conversion (pytest, no display needed)
#   2. live capture — only if Screen Recording is granted to the process
#                    running this script (Terminal / the IDE). If it is not,
#                    the live steps SKIP with a message and the script still
#                    exits 0: an ungranted permission is not a test failure.
#   3. MCP wire    — spawn the server with the claude-code profile against a
#                    stub screencapture (a generated PNG), call capture, and
#                    assert the image block. Runs whether or not (2) could.
#   4. hands off   — Moe's hands stop the moment a human takes over: the
#                    `moe-home/tools/mac.sh` side of abort-on-user-input, end
#                    to end, with a stub standing in for the event tap so
#                    nothing has to be clicked and no permission is needed.
#                    Needs no Hermes at all, so it runs even when 1–3 skip.

# 4. the hands-off guard, deleted ---------------------------------------------
#
# There were forty-odd checks here for a guard that watched the session's
# CGEvent stream and refused to act when it thought a human had taken over.
# It is gone, and so are they.
#
# It could not work. cua-driver's foreground path posts "a genuine HID key
# transition" — its own words — so that Chromium content and native menu
# equivalents receive it, which means it is indistinguishable from hardware by
# design: source pid 0, the same as the keyboard. Three thresholds were tried
# in one evening (3 points summed for the watcher's life; 32 points in a
# 400 ms burst; trusting the driver's bundle id) and every one of them fired
# on Moe rather than on the owner. Four of his sessions were refused by it,
# and each refusal told him he had touched a mouse he had not touched.
#
# Stopping is a person's decision now, not an inference: the notch changes
# colour while Moe drives and carries a stop that ends the run. The test for
# that lives with the island, where a person can actually be modelled.
#
# What is kept here is the one assertion that matters going forward — that
# nothing consults a guard any more — and it lives in the confirm-hook suite,
# next to the gate that used to call it.

# 5. Spaces: a window one desktop away ---------------------------------------
#
# The suite forces the macOS-native backend above, so until now nothing here
# ever exercised cua-driver — the backend that actually runs. On 2026-09-03
# capture(app='Calendar') reported "<no on-screen window matched>" for a
# window that was open one Space away, and blamed localized app names, so the
# agent re-spelled "Calendar" for ninety seconds. These assert the message and
# the records, not merely that a call was allowed.
