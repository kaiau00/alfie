#
# ── What a seed is, since Hermes moved to Python 3.14 and `pm` ──────────────
#
#   hermes-agent/          the fork at one commit (tracked files only), with
#     .venv/               its sealed dependency environment
#     install-stamp.json   "updateMechanism: external" — Memoe updates this
#                          tree; Hermes never syncs or re-execs it at launch
#     .moe-seed-commit     which commit (refresh-hermes-seed.sh reads it)
#     .moe-seed-pruned     what staging removed (ditto)
#   tools/                 Hermes's own `pm` tool store: the Python the venv
#                          runs on, Node + npm (MCP servers, the WhatsApp
#                          bridge), uv, and whatever SEED_TOOLS adds. Hermes
#                          finds every one of them here by itself
#                          ($HERMES_HOME/tools/facts.json) and nowhere else —
#                          upstream 5e4a2a3d24 stopped reading $HERMES_HOME/node
#                          and the PATH.
#
# Both are built the way upstream builds its own sealed desktop payload
# (scripts/bundles/native.py): `pm.prepare_tools` for the store and
# `pm.build_env --sealed` for the venv, on the store's own interpreter. A
# sealed build drops the two .pth files that name the build machine; the tree
# is wired to its venv by a RELATIVE hermes-agent.pth instead, so it needs no
# rewriting at all.
#
# ── The rule this file exists to enforce ────────────────────────────────────
#
# Nothing in this seed comes from anybody's working Hermes. It used to: the
# seed was a copy of ~/.hermes's hermes-agent, python and node, by allowlist,
# out of the one directory on this Mac that holds auth.json, .env,
# mcp-tokens/, memories/ and sessions/. Now the code is `git archive` of a
# commit and everything else is built fresh into $OUT, so there is no route
# for a personal file to arrive. The leak gate at the end stays, and still
# fails on a planted leak (scripts/test-hermes-seed.sh), because a gate that
# has never been seen to fail is decoration.
#
# ── Absolute paths ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A venv is full of them: the shebang of every script in .venv/bin, `home =`
# in pyvenv.cfg, and the editable install's direct_url.json. They are
# rewritten to the literal @HERMES_ROOT@ here and substituted back on the
# user's Mac (HermesSeed.swift). That is what makes the seed the same bytes
# for everybody — which the gate at the end then proves, and which is also
# what lets a Sparkle delta skip all of it.
