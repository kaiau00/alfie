# Who may talk to Moe on a chat platform — Hermes's DM pairing, for the app.
#
# Hermes denies every sender until they are approved. The first message from
# a stranger gets a one-time code back; the operator approves the request
# and that user is on the allowlist for good. `hermes pairing` is the CLI
# for that; this wraps it in lines a program can read:
#
#   pairing.sh list              Hermes's own table (pending + approved)
#   pairing.sh list --json       pending requests as a JSON array, from the
#                                store files themselves (no subprocess):
#                                [{"platform": "telegram", "request_id": "0123…16 hex",
#                                  "user_name": "Ada", "user_id": "12345",
#                                  "age_minutes": 3, "created_at": 1756…}]
#                                — the same array hermes-connections.py --json
#                                puts under "pending_pairings"; codes are
#                                stored hashed and never appear anywhere
#   pairing.sh approve <platform> <request-id|code>
#                                → `hermes pairing approve`; exit 0 and
#                                "✓ approved …" on success, 1 and Hermes's
#                                own last line otherwise (not found/expired,
#                                or a lockout after too many wrong codes)
#   pairing.sh revoke <platform> <user-id>
#
# Arguments are checked before they reach argv: a platform is [a-z0-9_]+,
# an id is 16 hex characters (from `list`) or an 8-character code (what the
# bot DM'd the user — the app never sees those, but a person can relay one).
