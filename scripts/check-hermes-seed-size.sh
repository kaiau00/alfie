#
#   check-hermes-seed-size.sh <seed-dir>
#
# The seed is ~646 MB (290 MB code + sealed venv, 356 MB tool store; measured
# 2026-10-07 at fork 8998ffbe2e). Two ways it has gone wrong, both caught here:
#   - too SMALL: a half-copied seed (the floor, MOE_MIN_HERMES_MB, default 550);
#   - too BIG: the slimming did not run, so Chrome for Testing (330 MB) or
#     build-time files rode along and the download grew by half a gigabyte
#     (the ceiling, MOE_MAX_HERMES_MB, default 680 — measured + ~5%).
# And by name, because a size can drift for an honest reason and a 330 MB
# browser cannot: no chromium-* in tools/, no tools/node-*/include, and the
# .browser-pending marker that tells the fork's browser tools to say "still
# downloading" until Memoe's installer has put the browser in.
