# A confirmation card is bound to whoever asked for it (Sources/MoeDesign/
# ConfirmLifecycle.swift, tools/confirm.sh).
#
# On 2026-09-25 a scheduled job's watchdog killed the job while its WhatsApp
# card was up; the card had no idea and sat over the owner's chat for ninety
# minutes. These checks do the damage and look at what is left:
#
#   * the REAL moe-confirm, in `--withdraw-test` (the lifecycle with no window,
#     so nothing appears on anybody's screen): kill its requester, kill its
#     parent with SIGKILL, let its deadline pass, send it SIGTERM — and each
#     time require exit 7 and a sentence in the inbox saying nothing was sent;
#   * confirm.sh: kill it and require its card gone; a 7 from the card must
#     come back as 7 and must NOT open the AppleScript dialog;
#   * both together: confirm.sh running the real card, SIGKILLed.
#
# Needs a built MoeConfirm (`swift build --product MoeConfirm`). A missing
# binary FAILS rather than skipping: a check that cannot run is not a pass.
