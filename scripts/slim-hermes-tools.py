"""Slim a Hermes pm tool store for shipping inside Memoe's seed.

    slim-hermes-tools.py <store>            # do it
    slim-hermes-tools.py <store> --check    # say what would go; change nothing

Called by stage-hermes-seed.sh after pm.prepare_tools. Two things leave:

1. Chromium (Chrome for Testing, ~330 MB). pm pulls it in as agent-browser's
   dependency; Memoe's installer puts the same pinned, sha256-checked build
   into the store on first launch instead (fetch-hermes-browser.sh), so the
   download stays its old size. The store is left with `.browser-pending`,
   which the fork's browser tools read as "still downloading" until then.
2. Build-time-only files no seeded Hermes reads at run time: C headers
   (node's include/ is 64 MB of OpenSSL headers for every platform), man pages
   and doc directories, static archives, Python's Tk/IDLE/turtle/ensurepip.
   Lazy installs are off, so nothing compiles against them on a user's Mac.

pm records a digest of every entry it publishes and re-hashes it on an
explicit install. A slimmed entry would read as damaged and be "repaired" back
to full size, so each touched entry's digest is recomputed with pm's own
Facts.refresh_digests, pm's own step for exactly this. The store then says, truthfully, what it holds.
