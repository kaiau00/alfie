#
#   1. uv        pinned release, installer sha256-checked, into ~/.local/bin
#   2. Python    3.14, uv-managed (no Homebrew, no Xcode)
#   3. checkout  Izzy-Gottz/hermes-agent @ claude-code-runtime → ~/.hermes/hermes-agent
#                (existing checkout: fetch + fast-forward only; a dirty tree stops us)
#   4. venv      uv sync --locked in that checkout; `hermes` wrapper → ~/.local/bin
#   5. smoke     hermes --version, hermes doctor; then configure-hermes.py --check
#   6. cua-driver  the computer_use backend, so Moe can see and act on the
#                screen and be told whether it worked (the fallback cannot)
#   7. tools     Hermes's pm tool store ($HERMES_HOME/tools): node, npm, uv,
#                ffmpeg, ripgrep, the browser — Hermes looks nowhere else
#
# A seeded Mac (no .git) is refreshed to the pin, or — when the pin changes
# what the venv contains — given the seed this Memoe carries
# (scripts/reseed-hermes.sh, MOE_HERMES_SEED_BUNDLE).
#
# Every step prints ✓ or ✗ with a one-line reason; the full output of every
# command is in ~/.moe/logs/install-hermes.log. Exit 0 = Hermes is installed
# (the --check at the end may still list what configure-hermes.py has yet to
# do; that is the next step, not a failure of this one).
#
# Network trouble: a local TLS-inspecting proxy (Canopy and friends on
# 127.0.0.1) breaks uv's own certificate store and git's proxy discovery.
# Each network step is tried plainly first, then once more with
# NO_PROXY='*' UV_NATIVE_TLS=1 UV_SYSTEM_CERTS=1 (bypass the proxy, use the macOS keychain
# roots), and the ✗/✓ line says which one worked.

# took whatever the branch tip happened to be, which meant two people who
# installed on different days got different brains, and a bug report named a
# version that no longer existed. DISTRIBUTION.md §4 called that out as "right
# while the fork is ours and moves daily, wrong for a shipped product".
#
# Bump it deliberately: run the fork's tests, then paste the sha here. Set

# `~/.hermes/hermes-agent` has no `.git` since 0.3.13 — and it is moved forward
# by scripts/refresh-hermes-seed.sh, which refreshes tracked source and never
# rebuilds a venv. So a bump whose range touches `uv.lock`, `pyproject.toml` or
# `.python-version` REACHES NOBODY WHO ALREADY HAS MOE: the refresh refuses it,
# by design, because rebuilding the venv there would replace the interpreter.
#
# That refusal is loud on the user's Mac and silent to you, which is the wrong
# way round — CLAUDE.md moved install-override notices off the owner's island
# for exactly this reason. So ask before you paste:
#
#   git -C <fork> diff --name-only <old-pin> <new-pin> -- uv.lock pyproject.toml .python-version

# The wrapper is a console script for the venv, where PATH and Moe's

# A seed's venv is now built relocatable (pm.build_env, as upstream builds its
# own payloads), and its scripts find Python next to where they REALLY are:
#
#     '''exec' "$(dirname -- "$(realpath -- "$0")")"/'python3' "$0" "$@"
#
# A copy of that in ~/.local/bin looks for ~/.local/bin/python3 — absent, or
# somebody else's. So the wrapper is WRITTEN, in the classic shape uv itself
# writes for a non-relocatable venv: a shebang naming the venv's python. That
# shape is what three readers already rely on — Paths.isLaunchable requires
# the named interpreter to exist (a deleted ~/.hermes then reads "not
# installed", the 2026-09-10 fix), MacErase recognises it as Moe's by that
# interpreter, and `hermes doctor` accepts a regular file where it would call
# a link to the venv "broken". A path with a space cannot be a shebang; then
# the `'''exec' '<python>'` form uv uses for long paths, which isLaunchable

# browser (agent-browser + the Chrome for Testing it drives) ONLY in its `pm`
# tool store, $HERMES_HOME/tools — never $HERMES_HOME/node, never the PATH. And
# with lazy installs off (configure-hermes.py apply_dependency_seal) it will
# not fetch one on first use. So the store is filled here, where a download is
# expected, by the same `pm.prepare_tools` stage-hermes-seed.sh uses — pinned
# and sha256-checked against the fork's pm/lock.json. A seed already carries
# it; this then only confirms it.
#
# What this replaces: `npm install -g agent-browser` into $HERMES_HOME/node/bin,
# `agent-browser install` (Chromium into ~/.agent-browser) and
# `uv tool install browser-use`. Hermes now runs browser-use from its own venv
# (browser-harness is a core dependency) and agent-browser from the store.
#
# cua-driver is deliberately NOT in this list: a store copy outranks the
# /Applications/CuaDriver.app a Mac already granted Accessibility and Screen
# Recording to, and would ask for both again. Step 6 owns it.
#
# Not fatal: Hermes runs without any of these, and says which tool is missing.
