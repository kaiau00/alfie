# Hermes pre_tool_call hook: the two things that bound what Moe spends at
# Composio. HERMES-SURFACES.md §3.1, which had been written in five places
# and enforced in none.
#
# It answers two separate questions about one tool call, in this order:
#
#   1. THE CLOCK RULE. "Anything that runs on a clock against Composio is a
#      paid feature. Anything a person asks for, in the moment, is free."
#      A Composio call in a turn nobody asked for is blocked unless this
#      Mac's tenant is on a tier that pays for clocks. Free is NOT a
#      crippled tier: an interactive call is never touched by this rule.
#
#   2. THE CALL BUDGET. Every Composio call, on any tier, interactive or
#      scheduled, is counted against an hourly and a daily bound. Over
#      either one, it is blocked. This exists because of what the owner
#      said when the clock rule was being built — *"people will just set up
#      crons"* — and it is the half that does not depend on getting question
#      1 right.
#
# Why both, and why the budget is the load-bearing one
# ----------------------------------------------------
# Question 1 is answered from how the turn STARTED (below), which is a
# positive identification of a scheduled turn. Anything it cannot identify
# is treated as interactive — it fails OPEN on that axis, deliberately,
# because the alternative is a free Mac where Gmail stops working when a
# person asks for it, which is the exact failure the rule exists to avoid.
#
# That would leave a hole if question 2 did not exist. It does: whatever
# the clock check decides, the budget counts the call, and a runaway of any
# shape — a mis-classified cron, a retry loop, a tool that calls itself —
# hits the hourly bound within the hour. So the classification is allowed to
# be imperfect, and the bill is not.
#
# What this does NOT do, said plainly
# -----------------------------------
# The counters live on this Mac and this Mac's owner can delete them. That
# is fine: this is not a boundary against the person sitting here, who is
# allowed to spend their own allowance. It is a bound on runaway code and a
# refusal in front of a feature nobody costed. The boundary that matters for
# OUR shared Composio pool — 100K calls a month and 2,000 a minute across
# every tenant — has to be enforced where the calls are counted for everyone,
# which is the edge. §3.1 point 3. Nothing here substitutes for that.
#
# Failure policy is CLOSED, and it is closed toward FREE. Malformed input, a
# missing python3, an unreadable credential, an unwritable counter — every
# one of them blocks a Composio call rather than permitting it. A gate that
# opens when it is confused is not a gate, and the specific confusion to
# avoid is a corrupted credential file reading as "paid" and quietly
# spending someone into their cap, which they meet as Gmail breaking with
# nothing that names the cause.
#
# Bash 3.2 (macOS ships nothing newer) and no jq: python3 does the JSON.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The fast path, and why it is a substring test on the raw payload.
#
# This hook is on `matcher: ".*"` — it is handed EVERY tool call Moe makes,
# and the overwhelming majority have nothing to do with Composio. Spawning
# python3 for each of those would put an interpreter start in front of every
# tool call in the product.
#
# So: if the raw stdin does not contain the string at all, there is no
# Composio tool call in it and we are done. The test is deliberately loose in
# the permissive direction — a payload that merely MENTIONS the string (a
# message quoting a tool name, say) falls through to python, which then makes
# the real decision on the parsed `tool_name` and passes it. A false positive
# here costs one interpreter start. A false negative would be a hole, and a
# substring test cannot produce one: every name we gate contains this string.

# by Composio. That is what makes this a structural match rather than the
# enumerated-name kind CLAUDE.md warns about: a scheduled mail check somebody
# adds next month reaches Composio through the same server entry and is
# therefore already covered, whatever the job or the tool is called.
#
# The prefix is `mcp__composio` rather than `mcp__composio__` so that a
# per-tenant server key (`composio-<something>`, which §3.3s one-project-per-
# person design would produce) is covered the day it lands rather than
# silently falling outside the gate.
#
# scripts/test-composio-budget.sh asserts this prefix against
# configure-hermes.py itself, so renaming the server key there fails a test
# instead of turning this gate off.

#
# Hermes stamps a cron run`s agent with
#   session_id = f"cron_{job_id}_{timestamp}"        (cron/scheduler.py)
# and a subagent of that run carries it as parent_session_id, which
# agent/shell_hooks.py falls back to. So this prefix is a property of HOW
# THE TURN STARTED, set by the scheduler, and no job name appears anywhere
# in this file.
#
# It is still a string from someone else`s source, and if Hermes renames it
# this gate would go quiet rather than fail — the worst shape a guard can
# have. scripts/test-composio-budget.sh greps the INSTALLED scheduler for
# this literal and goes red if it moves, which turns a silent stand-down
# into a loud one.

# day. These replaced a single 120/1,000 pair that was set before there was a
# tier to key on.
#
# The hourly figure is deliberately about a THIRD of the day`s budget rather
# than a twenty-fourth. A person asking twenty-five things in one sitting is
# ordinary, and an hourly cap that forbade it would fire on real use — while a
# runaway held to a third a day still takes most of a day to catch.

# construction and the clock rule permits it Composio on a schedule. The
# gate belongs on the Mac only.
#
# It still counts (below) — "permitted a clock" was never "free to spend
# without limit", and the shared 2,000/minute is drawn on by paid tenants
# too.
# MOE_RUNS_IN says which runtime this is; it is an environment variable, and
# on a Mac the agent can reach the environment its own gateway is spawned
# with (launchctl setenv, then a relaunch). So the variable alone must not be
# what hands out the machine`s allowance and its clock: it is corroborated by
# the platform, which a process cannot lie about to itself. The machine is a
# Linux box (per its deploy config); a Mac saying "cloud" is a Mac.
# (Reviewer, 2026-09-06: MOE_RUNS_IN=cloud on a Mac bought `away` caps and a

def tier():
    """`free`, `away` or `away_plus`, from this Mac`s cached tier. Never `paid`.

    **The name still matters.** Slice 9 — paying creates a machine — is not
    built, so nothing ties this value to a payment yet: a webhook that sets it
    is the next thing to build. It is deliberately a tier and not an
    `is_paid` boolean, because a boolean called `is_paid` that actually meant
    something narrower is precisely the thing nobody re-checks.

    **What it reads, and the two signals it is NOT.** Not "does a credential
    file exist" — that died on 2026-09-04, when the owner decided free Macs
    enrol too so the edge can mint them a Composio project
    (HERMES-SURFACES §3.3), which made a credential mean "has a tenant" on
    every Mac that connects anything. And no longer `sync`, which was the
    stopgap that replaced it: `sync` separates an Away enrolment from a
    connections-only one, which is a question about uploading conversations
    and was never a question about money. A connections-only Mac can be
    paying, and under `sync` it read as free.

    `~/.moe/cloud/tier.json` is written by `CloudSync.refreshTierLocked` from
    `GET /v1/tenant`, which serves `moe.tenants.tier` — a column on the
    tenant record, which is what §3.1 said the real answer would be. It is
    honoured only beside a readable `credential.json` naming a tenant: a tier
    is a property of a tenant, and a tier file with no tenant behind it is an
    orphan — a crash between the two deletions in `forget()` — and reads as
    free.

    **Why a file and not a request.** This runs inside a tool call, before
    every Composio call. It must answer locally, synchronously, with no
    network: a version that asked the edge would put a round trip in front of
    every call and would fail OPEN the moment the edge was unreachable.

    **Fail closed toward free — and "closed" means FREE, not "refuse".** Every
    unreadable shape reads as `free`: missing, unparseable, not an object, an
    unrecognised or non-string tier, a `checked_at` that is missing, a string,
    a boolean, NaN, absurdly large, or outside its window. The failure this
    must not have is a corrupt or forged file reading as paid. The failure it
    must not have EITHER is a corrupt file making the interpreter crash, because
    the shell around this treats no answer as BLOCK — and blocking a person`s
    own Gmail question is the outage the whole rule exists to avoid. So the
    body is in a helper and this wrapper turns any exception into `free`.
    (Reviewer, 2026-09-06: a list as the tier, a 400-digit stamp and a
    100k-deep document each crashed the gate into "block everything".)

    **NaN is named because it is the one that walks past the window.**
    Python`s json accepts the literal; `time.time() - nan` is nan; nan is
    neither greater than thirty days nor less than minus one, so without
    `isfinite` a forged file reads as paid for ever. Foundation`s parser
    refuses NaN, so the app would report "no tier" while the gate spent on the
    top one. (Reviewer, 2026-09-06.)

    **The window is thirty days forward and one day back.** Forward is a
    month of grace for someone offline, and a bound on how long a cancelled
    subscription keeps working. Backward exists because a `checked_at` in the
    future never expires: without it, one bad clock — or one edited file —
    buys a permanent tier. A day of slack absorbs a timezone mistake and
    nothing larger.

    **The machine is not gated and does not read this.** See below: a machine
    exists only by enrolling under a tenant, so it is a paid runtime by
    construction, and no `tier.json` is written on it.
