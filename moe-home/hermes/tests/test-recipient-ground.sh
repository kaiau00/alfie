# Who a message goes to, and who asked for them — the send hook's recipient gate
# (tools/recipients.py, called from hooks/confirm-send.sh).
#
# The incident, 2026-09-25, replayed first: a scheduled job told "send ONE
# consolidated WhatsApp message to Jordan" (the owner) called
# whatsapp_send(to="Walter Brennan") — the owner's grandfather, named only in
# the memory block of the system prompt, never by the person and never by a
# lookup. The hook deferred to the connector's own dialog, which would have
# named a real chat. These cases fail on a hook without the gate.
#
# The ledger Hermes writes (hermes-agent agent/recipient_grounding.py, format
# version 2: each thing said with who said it) is written here by hand, with
# the `.enabled` marker Hermes leaves beside it, under a scratch HERMES_HOME.
# The dialog is a stub that records what it was shown and the provenance it was
# handed; nothing is ever sent and no real home is read. The case-by-case
# judgement is tests/test_recipients.py, run at the end.
