"""Every tool name Moe's own Hermes plugins register, read out of their source.

The gate's `BUILTIN` table in `hooks/confirm-send.sh` is a hand-written list,
and a Moe plugin tool missing from it is classified `unknown`, which puts a
"This is not a tool Moe recognises" dialog in front of the person — over one
of Moe's own tools. That has now happened three times, each time found by the
owner rather than by a test:

    moe_followups      2026-09-06   "stop reminding me about that"
    cronjob_manage     2026-09-11   "check in on me in five minutes"
    connections_list   2026-09-20   "are you connected to my gmail and github?"

A list that is kept in step by remembering is a list that goes out of step.
`test-confirm-hook.sh` runs this, and requires the gate to classify every name
it prints as something other than `unknown`, so the next omission is a red
suite here instead of a dialog there.

    plugin-tool-names.py <plugins-dir>

Only names that are LITERAL in the source are printed. The per-connector
`<name>_<verb>` tools are built in a loop from the connector list and have no
literal to read; they are declared by the connector manifests, which the gate
reads directly, so they are covered and are not this file's business.

Deliberately reads the source rather than importing it: importing a plugin
runs its module body, which on this Mac reaches Hermes, the person's config
and their connectors. A test must not need any of that to be true.
