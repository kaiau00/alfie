"""What is connected through Hermes on this machine, with real status.

The companion of hermes-catalog.py (what *could* be connected). This one
reads the live Hermes state under $HERMES_HOME —

  config.yaml        mcp_servers.<name>, platforms.<name>.enabled
  .env               which keys are set (names only; a value never leaves
                     this process, and the one we use — API_SERVER_KEY, to
                     ask the gateway — is sent to 127.0.0.1 and nothing else)
  mcp-tokens/*.json  OAuth token presence and expiry
  auth.json          provider logins Hermes keeps itself (spotify)
  <credential files> skills' required_credential_files (a token beside .env …)

— and one file under $MOE_HOME: watch/.skipped.json, the table the person's
cloud computer sends back naming the watches it holds a recipe for but could
not schedule because the connection never reached it (docs/LOOPS.md §4, S6).
A connection named there gets one more sentence on its row, and loses it the
moment the table no longer names it.

— and then, where it is cheap, asks for the truth rather than trusting a
file: `hermes mcp test <name>` for an MCP server, the gateway's
/health/detailed for a platform. A token on disk is not a connection;
PRODUCT.md §4.4 calls the real check the strength worth keeping.

  hermes-connections.py [list] [--live] [--json]
        one line per configured connection:  <kind>/<name>\t<state>: <detail>
        --live adds the real checks (a few seconds); default is files only
        --json: {"connections": [...one object per line above...],
                 "pending_pairings": [...]} — the pairing requests waiting
        for an Approve (hermeslib.pending_pairings: platform, request_id,
        user_name, user_id, age_minutes, created_at), so the app shows the
        button without a second call. Was a bare array before 2026-08-30.
  hermes-connections.py names           just "<kind>/<name>": files, plus
        Composio's list (its last one when under five minutes old)
  hermes-connections.py status <kind>/<name>
        the connector contract: prints "ok: …" | "needs-setup: …" |
        "unavailable: …", exit 0 / 1 / 3 — what doctor.sh and
        lib/connectors.sh run for a virtual connector. Always live.
  hermes-connections.py manifest <kind>/<name>
        KEY=value lines in the connectors/*.manifest format, so
        connector_field works on a virtual connector. Offline for anything
        but a Composio service, and that from Composio's last answer when it
        is under five minutes old (MOE_COMPOSIO_CACHE_SECONDS).
  hermes-connections.py brief           the same list as a few lines for the
        model's system prompt (what sync.sh writes to context/_connections.md)
  hermes-connections.py refresh         write that to
        $MOE_HOME/context/_connections.md now, atomically — and the same
        facts as JSON to _connections.json beside it, which travels to the
        person's cloud computer (the `context/connections` document) so a
        machine with no Mac knows what is behind COMPOSIO_SEARCH_TOOLS.
        connect.sh runs this after anything that changes a connection, so Moe
        knows about a mailbox the moment it is added instead of on the next
        ten-minute sync.
  hermes-connections.py pull …          exit 1, nothing: Hermes's tools are
        live, not cached context — sync.sh never pulls these.
  hermes-connections.py crawl <kind>/<name> [--since N]
        read-only GATHER of any MCP connection: lib/mcp_autoread discovers the
        connection's tools, keeps only safe metadata reads, a no-tools turn
        picks the calls, and lib/mcp_read executes them — the gathered text on
        stdout, flag-stripped and bounded. Nothing (exit 0) if nothing readable.

$HOME / $HERMES_HOME / $HERMES_BIN redirect everything (tests). No browser
is ever opened: every hermes subprocess runs with SSH_TTY set and stdin
closed, which is what makes Hermes's OAuth code print a URL instead of
launching one.

    what the sentences below use. The slug is the file name, not a word anybody
    says, and it used to land on screen as "Moe's cloud receives whatsapp now".

    **Why this comes before every other branch.** A channel the cloud holds is
    switched off on this Mac by name (`configure-hermes.py::apply_channel_holder`)
    — deliberately, because Telegram permits a webhook OR ``getUpdates`` and
    never both, and a Mac that kept polling one the edge had taken made
    Telegram refuse it and the adapter delete the edge's webhook to recover
    (2026-09-14). Read without this, that platform lands in the
    "switched off — turn it back on in config.yaml" branch below, which would
    tell somebody to undo the thing keeping their bot working.

    **And before the no-credentials gate, which is what actually bit.** Being
    held by the cloud is not one of several opinions about a channel — it is
    the reason there is nothing on this Mac to find. Handing a channel over
    moves its token off this Mac, so `have` is empty and
    `platforms.<name>.enabled` is false, and `platform_connections` used to
    `continue` past such a row before ever calling this function. The row then
    did not exist at all, the app built one from the catalog with no state, and
    a WhatsApp and a Slack that the owner's cloud computer was answering both
    read "not connected" with a Connect button (2026-09-15). Worse, the Slack
    row's own `say` — a sentence `channel-holder.py` had written for him,
    asking him to reconnect it — reached no surface at all.

    Three opinions exist about a channel and this screen must show the one that
    decides. The marker is what this Mac believes; `channel-holder.json` is
    what the **provider** last said, written by `connectors/channel-holder.py`

    already in the brief" — and every one of those sentences is false on the

    two Gmails it is reading), and never a count, a token or an address of
    a server.

    Canonical (sorted keys, no spaces) so the bytes change only when the
    connected set does: the file travels as the `context/connections`

    about which services exist, and until 2026-09-07 the only thing that ever
    wrote it was `sync.sh`, on its ten-minute tick. So the ten minutes after
    someone connected a mailbox were exactly the ten minutes in which Moe
    would tell them, confidently and in the connector's own words, that "no
    mailbox is added yet" and offer to walk them through connecting the thing
    they had just connected. That is the report this verb exists for, and the
    measured gap in it was 88 seconds: connected at 21:34, asked at 21:36,
    file rewritten at 21:47.

    Written through a temporary file in the same directory and renamed, so a
