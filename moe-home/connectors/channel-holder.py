"""Who is actually holding each chat app — asked of the provider, not of us.

  channel-holder.py check     ask each provider where it sends, and record it
  channel-holder.py heal      …and put one back that has drifted (bounded)
  channel-holder.py say       the sentences only, for a screen

**The failure this exists for, measured on the owner's account 2026-09-14.**
Their cloud machine was paired at 01:17Z. `channels.py migrate` did its job:
the edge took the Telegram app, `setWebhook` pointed the bot at it, and this
Mac wrote `cloud/channel-telegram.json`. But this Mac's gateway was still
polling with `getUpdates`, and Telegram permits a webhook OR polling and never
both. Telegram refused the poll — `can't use getUpdates method while webhook
is active` — and the adapter "recovered" by calling `deleteWebhook`. That
webhook was the edge's. From then on the machine they pay for could not
receive one message, `channel_bindings` stayed empty, and **both halves went
on reporting themselves connected**, because each was reading its own config.

Three opinions exist about a channel and only one of them decides:

  * `MOE_HOME/cloud/channel-<name>.json`  — what this Mac believes
  * `moe_auth.channel_apps` at the edge   — what the edge believes
  * the provider                          — where the messages actually go

This asks the third one, and what "asking" means differs by channel.
`getWebhookInfo` for Telegram and the webhook endpoint read for LINE — both
name an address. Slack and Discord name none: the edge opens a connection
outwards to them and holds it, so what decides is whether the platform took
that connection, which only the edge knows (`GET /v1/channels/<name>/socket`).
WhatsApp Business is the one left that a person points by hand in a dashboard,
and it has no read-back at all — so it is reported as *unknown* rather than
guessed at. An answer invented for a channel that cannot be asked would be the
same lie in a new place.

**Nothing here prints a bot token, a webhook path or a device credential.** The
token is in the URL of every Telegram call, so no URL is ever logged; a webhook
address is compared and reported as *ours* or *somewhere else*, never quoted.

**Repair is bounded and it goes through `channels.py`.** Re-pointing a webhook
channel needs the shared secret the edge verifies it with, which this Mac
deliberately does not keep — so the repair is `channels.py register <channel>`,
which mints a new secret, hands it to the edge and points the provider at the
result in one step. For a socket channel there is no address to re-point and
the repair is `channels.py socket <channel>`, which hands the keys over again
and waits for the platform to confirm. At most `MAX_REPAIRS` of either per
channel, never twice inside `REPAIR_COOLDOWN_S`, and the counter resets the
moment a check finds the channel carrying again. A self-heal with no ceiling
is a loop that bills somebody.

#: dead for the rest of the window. The cooldown above protects a message in
#: flight and a contested channel; a channel pointed at no address has neither.
#: There is nothing a wait can improve and nobody to tug against, so waiting
#: is purely time in which nothing reaches the person.
