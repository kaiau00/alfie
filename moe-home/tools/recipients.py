"""Who a message is going to, and who asked for them.

One question every send path asks before a message leaves, answered in one
place: the send hook (hermes/hooks/confirm-send.sh), and each of Alfie's own
connectors (whatsapp.sh, telegram.py, gmail.py) after it has resolved a name
to an address.

The incident this exists for, 2026-09-25: a scheduled job told "send ONE
WhatsApp message to Jordan" (the owner) called
whatsapp_send(to="Walter Brennan") — the owner's grandfather, the only
WhatsApp contact named in memory. No lookup. The resolver did exactly what it
was asked; nothing anywhere could tell that nobody had asked for him.

Nothing here knows about grandfathers, WhatsApp or any one tool.

1. **Is this the owner?** The owner is DATA: `$MOE_HOME/owner.json` (written by
   configure-hermes.py on every sync) plus the same sources read live — the
   Telegram id Hermes answers to, the WhatsApp number (and @lid) this Mac is
   linked as, the Google address it signed in with, the mailboxes it reads,
   the Mac account's name, and whatever the person pinned (nicknames too).
   A contact tool whose only recipient is the owner is refused unless the
   request asked to reach the owner; `reach_owner` is the right door.

2. **Did the OWNER name this person?** Hermes writes, per conversation, what
   was said and who said it, and what tools returned
   (`$HERMES_HOME/grounding/<sha256(key)[:32]>.json`; hermes-agent
   `agent/recipient_grounding.py` states the format). A recipient is:

   - `named`   — the owner's own words say it, in full;
   - `partial` — the owner said only part of it ("Walter") and Alfie picked the
                 rest ("Walter Brennan"): allowed, the card says so in amber;
   - `found`   — a real LOOKUP returned it (contacts, chats, mail search — an
                 allowlist; never a web page, a shell, a file read or memory):
                 allowed, amber, with the source;
   - `shown`   — an ADDRESS Alfie read off a page or the screen in this
                 conversation (a browser, web or screen tool's result — never
                 one the call itself was handed), then named in its own message
                 immediately before the owner's latest one, which says yes
                 ("good", "send it"). Never silent: always the card, in amber,
                 saying where it was found and what the owner said; no session
                 grant covers it. Alfie's own words never ground anyone — an
                 address it invented is in no page, and one on a page it never
                 showed was never agreed to;
   - otherwise refused: look the person up or ask.

   Words count only when the OWNER said them: the Mac's own person-started
   turns, or a chat message whose sender id is the owner's. A job's prompt, a
   delegated goal, a summary, another person's message are context: they can
   refuse a recipient or flag a mismatch, never ground one.

   Hermes writes `grounding/.enabled` beside its ledgers. With the marker there,
   a missing, unreadable or old-format ledger is a refusal. With no marker (a
   Hermes from before this) nothing is refused for grounding and nothing is
   said about it on the card.

Stdlib only, Python 3.9 (macOS's /usr/bin/python3). Importable, and a CLI:

    recipients.py gate --to RAW [--to RAW…] [--resolved ADDR…] [--channel C]
        prints three lines — ok|refuse, the refusal (or empty), provenance JSON
        exit 0 ok, 3 refused
    recipients.py owner          the owner identity, as JSON
    recipients.py write-owner    write $MOE_HOME/owner.json from the sources
    recipients.py is-owner ADDR  exit 0 when ADDR is the owner
