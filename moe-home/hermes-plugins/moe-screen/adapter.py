"""`moe`: the Mac's screen as a Hermes gateway platform.

Outbound only. Nothing ever arrives FROM this platform — Moe talks to Hermes
over the api_server — so there is no stream to subscribe to, no message
handler, no user identity. What the adapter has is a `send()`, and that is
what makes `deliver: moe` a real cron target: the scheduler resolves the
platform through the registry, finds the live adapter the gateway connected
at start-up (or, with no gateway in the process, calls
`standalone_sender_fn`) and hands over the job's final response.

Why a platform and not a file watcher on ~/.hermes/cron/output: the output
directory holds every run of every job, delivered or not, and "was this
already sent somewhere" is not written there. A platform is the seam Hermes
provides for exactly this — `all` expands to it, `hermes send --to moe`
reaches it, the dashboard lists it, and a job's `last_delivery_error` says
so if it failed.

The second thing registered here is a `pre_tool_call` hook on the `cronjob`
tool. A job created from a Moe conversation records an origin of
`api_server:<session id>`, and the api_server adapter's `send()` is a stub
that returns "API server uses HTTP request/response, not send()". Measured
2026-09-02 on a one-shot reminder: ran on time, reply produced, three
delivery errors, nothing reached the user. Hermes has no default-delivery
key to point at, so the hook rewrites `origin` to `moe` for jobs created
from surfaces that cannot receive one. A job made from a chat app becomes
`moe:<app>`: a reminder asked for on Telegram still comes back on Telegram,
through the one owner path that works whichever side fronts the app.

    Only the `cronjob` tool, only `create` (an `update` with no `deliver`
    means "leave it", and must), and only when the target is the origin —
    given or implied — of a session whose platform has no send path, or a
    bare `local` from such a session (see below). A bare chat-app name
    (`telegram`, `moe,whatsapp`) becomes `moe` — the owner, where they are —
    or `moe:<app>` when the person's own words named that app
    (`owner_routed` says why). Anything else
    the model chose is left alone: `all`, `telegram:<chat>` and `local` from a
    chat platform work as written. `origin,all` becomes `moe,all`; the `all`
    half already expands to the screen and every connected home channel, so
    the user is not told twice.

    The second thing it does, on `create` only: a job the person asked for in
    a conversation runs on the conversation's model. Hermes's `cron.model` is
    the fleet's cheap default, and Moe sets it to the provider's cheapest
    model so its own nudges never cost the plan (docs/DEFAULTS.md row 43).
    A job like "sign in to my X and follow two dozen accounts" is not a
    nudge; it acts in the person's name, and on 2026-09-18 it ran on haiku
    (ticket #5). `model: conversation` is the fork's word for "whatever the
    conversation runs on, read at fire time, provider included", so a later
    brain change carries the job along and nothing is pinned by name. A
    `model` the model itself chose is left alone.
