"""A routine the person asked for that keeps failing is said, in Alfie's words.

Hermes reports a failing cron job two ways, and neither reaches a person as
something they can act on:

* a run that errors is delivered as a notice — ``⚠️ Cron 'name' failed: …``
  (cron/scheduler.py ``_summarize_cron_failure_for_delivery``) — which
  ``deliver.is_machinery`` drops from the island, rightly for Alfie's own jobs;
* a run that ends *blocked* delivers the model's own reply, and from the
  third in a row Hermes appends "This job has failed N runs in a row — worth
  a review. Fix its prompt/config, or pause it with `hermes cron pause …`",
  which is instructions for a developer with a terminal.

The owner's "X daily growth" routine was blocked nine days running
(2026-09-16 → 09-24) and nobody was told: the drop above, and a
``deliver: local`` that sent the rest to a file. The delivery is repaired
elsewhere; this is the telling. For a job the **person** made (it carries an
origin; Alfie's own jobs never do) a failure becomes one plain sentence at the
second failure in a row, again at the seventh, and then fortnightly — a
routine that fails every day is worth hearing about, not every day. Alfie's
own jobs are unchanged: dropped and logged, as before.

**Since 2026-10-07 the telling is not done at delivery time.** Two holes in
it, both from ticket #15: it only ever saw a failure that was *delivered to
``moe``* (the ticket's job delivered to WhatsApp, failed to resolve a
target, and so reached nobody — not even this adapter), and it counted to
two before speaking, which a one-off job never reaches. The person learned
about it only by asking. So the failure notice is now dropped here like any
other, and ``tell_failures`` below — run every five minutes by
``moe-loop-check``, reading Hermes's own job records — puts one card in front
of the person per failure *episode*, with a one-tap answer (docs/INBOX-QUIET.md):
"Show me what went wrong" and "Run it again", or "Show me what it said" for a
run whose message never arrived. A one-off is told at its failure; a routine
at its second failure in a row (one is weather); a run that was blocked, or
whose message reached nobody, at once. Then nothing more until the job works
again — no seventh-failure reminder, no card per retry.

Stdlib only, never raises.
