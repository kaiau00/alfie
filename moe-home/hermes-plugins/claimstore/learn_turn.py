"""Per-turn learning: what the person just said, kept as claims, with no one
asking (docs/PROACTIVE-MEMORY.md §3.1, the first of three speeds).

Hermes calls ``sync_turn`` after every completed turn, on its background
worker, never on the reply path (agent/memory_manager.py ``sync_all``). Until
2026-09-24 claimstore ignored it, and memory grew only when the model chose to
call its ``memory`` tool (29 times in ~700 turns) or when the background
review ran (every ten turns; 10 of 57 wrote anything). This reads each turn
once and keeps what is durable.

The rules, each of them structural rather than a hope about the prompt:

* **Add only.** One small-model call may propose claims; it can never update
  or retract one. Contradictions are the nightly pass's job, where a diff can
  be shown. A hot-path model that edits memory is the documented failure.
* **The person's words, quoted, and checked.** Every proposal carries the
  exact words it rests on; a quote that is not in what the person said is
  dropped, and so is a fact with a name or number they did not say
  (``supports``, free). What survives is put to a second call on the same
  cheap model (``verify``), shown only the person's words and the facts:
  "is this directly supported, with nothing added?" Only a yes is kept, and
  an unreadable answer is a no. Most turns propose nothing, so the second
  call is rare.
* **The cheapest model the person's provider serves** (lib/cheap_model.py),
  never their conversation's model: every turn pays for this, and on an API
  key it is billed.
* **Only a turn the person started is read** (``refusal``). The app declares
  every turn it sends (``X-Hermes-Turn-Origin``, at each call site, never
  guessed from text): a helper's result, a restored transcript, a nudge note
  and meeting notes are ``background`` and are never learned from; on the
  app's own channel an undeclared turn is not the person's either. A cron
  run and a bot-authored turn are refused the same way.
* **Only the person's words are read.** Alfie's own wrapping (the Now line, the
  brief, the reminder, parenthetical notes, whatever it carries in front of
  the turn above its ``---``, any tagged block) is stripped with the same
  ``persons_words`` the loop sweep uses, so a brief's calendar or somebody's
  mail quoted into the prompt is not the person talking. Fenced and
  ``>``-quoted blocks are pasted, not said, and are left out too. A long turn
  keeps its newest words.
* **Never a revival, never a nag.** Claims are written as ``moe:turn``,
  which is not a person source (store.revives). A fact somebody deleted is
  not proposed again at all, and only a claim that is live after the write
  is reported as noted, so "Noted · Undo" is never shown for something Undo
  cannot reach.
* **Free gate first.** A turn with too few words of the person's own is not
  read at all: "thanks", "ok go on", "what time is it" cost nothing.
* **Background thinking off means off**, like every other model call Alfie makes
  on its own.

Every outcome is one log line, including "nothing": a learner that cannot be
seen to run cannot be told from one that stopped.

Stdlib only; ``call`` is injected (``default_call``: Hermes's ``call_llm``
pinned to the cheapest tier by lib/cheap_model.py).
