"""Memory saves never fail (docs/DEFAULTS.md row 39).

Hermes's memory tool refuses an ``add`` or ``replace`` that would push
``MEMORY.md`` / ``USER.md`` past ``memory_char_limit`` / ``user_char_limit``
(``tools/memory_tool.py`` at the checkout, ``tools/memory_tool_store.py`` at
the pin: "… would exceed the limit. Consolidate now …"). Under claimstore that
refusal is wrong twice over: the files are not the store — the ledger is, and
it has no cap — and the projection already knows how to fit the ledger into
the files (``projection.render``: newest kept, oldest out of the digest and
still reachable by recall). But a refused write never reaches the ledger,
because ``on_memory_write`` fires only on success. So the person heard "I
couldn't save that".

The seam, without touching the fork: Hermes's ``tool_execution`` middleware
(``hermes_cli/middleware.py``), which wraps the ``memory`` tool on both the
sequential and the concurrent agent paths (``agent/tool_executor.py``,
``agent/agent_runtime_helpers.invoke_tool``) — the Claude Code brain's bridged
``memory`` calls land in that same ``invoke_tool`` — and is handed the result
before the model sees it. A plugin registers it from ``register(ctx)``; a
memory provider's collector forwards every ``register_*`` to a real
``PluginContext``.

What it does, and only this:

1. run the tool (``next_call``), untouched;
2. if the tool refused for want of room — its own words, **and** the file it
   reads really would overflow with this write (so a refusal for any other
   reason — no match, an approval denied, a batch — is never turned into a
   save) — and the content passes the tool's own injection scan;
3. take the write into the ledger the way a successful write would have been
   (``ClaimStoreProvider.on_memory_write``), re-project the file under the
   cap, and confirm the claim is live;
4. answer the model with the tool's own success shape, so it never sees
   "exceeds the char limit" and never loops consolidating.

Anything it cannot do cleanly returns Hermes's original result: this can make
a refusal into a save, never a save into a refusal.

Four rules the review of 2026-09-15 added, each with its test:

* **Only the session's own provider.** The call's ``session_id`` must be the
  session a writing provider was initialized for. There is no "the only live
  provider" fallback: a cron job keeps the memory tool, and its refusal must
  not be written into the person's memory by the chat's provider — a refusal
  must never become a save a success would not have made.
* **A refusal leaves the ledger exactly as it was.** Everything that could
  make the save fail (a restated deleted fact, which becomes a question; a
  replace whose ``old_text`` addresses no single digest entry) is checked
  *before* anything is written, so a replace is never told "refused" after
  its old fact was already retracted.
* **A kept claim is a save.** If re-projecting the file fails after the claim
  is live, the answer is still success — the next projection fits the file.
* **The wording is checked by arithmetic too.** A refusal that is "no room" by
  the numbers but not in the words is logged once at WARNING, so a Hermes
  wording change cannot switch this off silently.
