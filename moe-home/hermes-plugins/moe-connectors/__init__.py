"""moe-connectors — the person's own accounts, as Hermes tools.

Hermes could reach two MCP servers, `vercel` and `pulse`, and nothing in
~/.moe/connectors. sync.sh ran the connectors on a timer, wrote
context/_brief.md, and Alfie pasted that file into the system prompt; that
snapshot was the entire bridge between a person's mail and the thing answering
questions about it. Asked to summarise today's email with the brief absent, the
model reached for the only tool it could see with "messages" in the name,
`mcp__pulse__search_messages`, and reported the mail was not connected. It had
been there all along with nothing able to call it.

Why a plugin and not an MCP server
----------------------------------

The first version of this was an MCP server, and it worked — Hermes found it in
385 ms and listed 45 tools. But MCP names every tool after the server it came
from, `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, hardwired in tools/mcp_tool.py with no aliasing.
Through Hermes's own proxy the model ended up reading:

    mcp__hermes-tools__mcp__moe__gmail_pull

Three namespaces and two product names in front of the verb, and one of those
product names is the model itself. Alfie is not a service the agent calls to ask
about email; Alfie is the agent. A tool list that says otherwise is telling it
something false about its own shape.

Registered here instead, the model sees `gmail_pull` beside `terminal` and
`web_search`, with no prefix and no seam. Three things follow for free: it runs
in the gateway rather than behind a pipe, so there is no subprocess per
connector; `toolset` puts it in Hermes's own enable/disable machinery; and
`emoji` is the one Hermes shows for the step, which is what Alfie speaks aloud
while the work runs.

What it exposes
---------------

Every verb of every connector, read from connectors/*.manifest — which already
declares `verbs` for exactly this — so a connector added tomorrow appears
without editing this file. Nothing is curated: the rule for connections is
bridge the whole catalogue, never hand-pick, and a list maintained here would
be a second catalogue to disagree with the first.

What a verb takes is declared in the manifest too — `send_stdin=to[]* body*`,
`find_args=name*` — and the schema the model sees is built from that: `_stdin`
pipes one JSON object to the connector, `_args` passes them positionally, `[]`
is a list and `*` is required. Verbs every connector implements identically
(`crawl`, with its `--since`/`--max-bytes` flags) are declared once in
VERB_FLAGS below rather than twelve times.

This is not decoration. Every verb used to advertise a single `args` array
described as "usually empty", so a model asked to send an email had nowhere to
put the recipient, the subject or the words: it called `gmail_send` with `{}`,
and the confirmation dialog correctly showed a person no recipient and no
message. Nor could a filled-in array have worked — `gmail.py send` and
`telegram.py send` refuse argv outright and read one JSON object on stdin,
which this plugin had no way to write to.

Each verb runs as a subprocess with a per-verb timeout, exactly as sync.sh runs
it. That matters more here than it did over MCP: this code is inside the
gateway, so a wedged IMAP login must be the connector's problem and never the
gateway's.

Sending is exposed like everything else and is not made safe here. gmail.py
send opens a macOS confirmation before it opens a socket, WhatsApp and Telegram
sends go through confirm.sh, and Hermes's confirm-send.sh hook sits in front of
all of it. Three gates that already existed; this adds no fourth and removes
none.

On the away machine
-------------------

The same plugin runs in the cloud (docs/CLOUD-PLAN.md §11.1), where
`MOE_RUNS_IN=cloud` and `$MOE_HOME` is a seed the image put on the volume.
Three things differ there, and only three: `send` and `voice` are not offered
at all (HEADLESS_VERBS — every send gate is a dialog on a Mac's screen, and
the machine's own gate is slice 4), said once in the gateway log; a connector
whose script ran but found no credentials answers "not connected on the away
machine yet" instead of pointing the person at a Mac-side script; and a
connector the manifest says runs somewhere else is **detached**. A missing
`$MOE_HOME` is a WARNING in the gateway log, not an empty tool list.

Detached, not hidden (LEDGER-WIRE §14, CLOUD-PLAN §13)
------------------------------------------------------

Slice 2½ dropped `runs_in=mac` connectors off the machine's catalogue, so the
model there could not see that the person had Notes at all — a silent
capability loss dressed as a filter. A tool is attached, detached or absent,
and **a detached tool is callable**: it stays registered, and calling it
appends an `intent` record sealed under the conversation's thread key, which
the Mac's drain carries out when it next wakes. The model gets back
`{"success": true, "deferred": true, "intent": …, "result": one sentence}` —
the sentence names the hand and offers the two real options, doing it when the
Mac wakes or answering from what is already known.

Absent is different and must never be queued. `send` and `voice` are withheld
here rather than deferred (§14.4 rule 5), and a connector that could not queue
says so plainly: "I'll do it when your Mac wakes" about a record nobody wrote
is a lie with a delay on it.

What the Mac says it can do (LEDGER-WIRE §14.4a)
------------------------------------------------

`$MOE_HOME` on the machine is a picture of the *shipped catalogue*, not of the
person's Mac, so "there is a chrome.manifest" never meant "this person turned
Chrome on". The machine used to offer to queue `chrome_pull` for someone who
never enabled Chrome, and `imessage_pull` on a Mac without Full Disk Access;
the failure arrived five minutes later — §4.4's "lie with a delay on it" by a
different road. So the Mac publishes what it can actually do as a `document`
named `capability/<via>` (§13.5), and this plugin *reads* it. It never writes
one: that is the draining side's half. Three states, decided by evidence
rather than by assumption — **attached** runs here, **detached** queues
because the Mac said `ok`, and **absent** — the Mac said `needs-setup` or
`absent` for that exact target and action — is withheld and never queued.
Everything else is *unseen*: it queues, and the sentence says it cannot see
whether the thing is set up over there rather than promising that it is. No
document at all (the normal case until a Mac publishes one), a document that
will not open, one that does not mention this target or this action (silence
withdraws nothing — rule 8's "missing is not gone" binds a reader too), and
one older than §14.4a's seven days (there is no heartbeat here, so a Mac shut
for a fortnight stops being quoted about today) are all unseen, never absent.

Wherever it runs, a connector subprocess gets the gateway's environment with
the gateway's secrets taken out (connector_env): the scripts read MOE_* and
the two Telethon app credentials, and nothing else that could be a key.

# closing tag inside the payload (agent/tool_dispatch_helpers.py). Moe's
# connectors get none of it, for two independent reasons: that code lives in
# the native tool loop, which the claude_code runtime does not use, and its
# trigger set is {web_extract, web_search} plus the browser_/mcp_ prefixes —
# `gmail_pull` and `whatsapp_pull` match nothing.
#
# Which is the wrong way round. A web page the user asked Moe to read is a
# risk; an email ANYBODY can send to the user's inbox, arriving unrequested
# and read by a background crawl, is the sharper one. Moe's whole threat model
# is prompt injection in something the user did not write, and the mail path
# was the one surface with no framing at all.
#
# Done here rather than as a hook because this plugin OWNS these tools. A
# transform_tool_result hook would work in principle, but it is fail-open by
# contract, its shell form has no documented way to return a replacement
# string, and the plugin's Python hooks are not registered in the MCP bridge
# process at all (it calls agent.shell_hooks.register_from_config and nothing
# else). Wrapping at the single return point below is the one place that
# cannot be skipped, because it IS the tool.
#
# Verbs, not connectors. `pull`, `crawl`, `chats`, `find` and `voice` return
# text other people wrote. `status` and `accounts` return Moe's own state, and

    **Never for a detached connector** (§14.5). This function's whole subject
    is a script that ran here and found no credentials; a detached connector's
    script is not on this machine at all, and its answer is a deferred result,

# The same service, connected the other way.
#
# Gmail, Calendar and Drive each have two routes into Moe: this Mac's own
# connector (an app password, Calendar.app, the synced Drive folder) and
# Composio. Composio is the one a new person connects — it leads the
# Connections screen — so the Mac route is usually NOT set up, and its
# `status` honestly says `needs-setup`. That sentence is about one route, and
# the model read it as being about the service.
#
# Measured on the owner's Mac, 2026-09-16: Gmail connected through Composio
# (owner@example.com), the system prompt rebuilt at 12:47:32 to say so, and at
# 12:47:37 `gmail_status` answered "needs-setup: no mailbox added yet". Moe
# told him — twice, across two turns — that his Gmail was not connected, until
# he said "check through Composio". A tool result five seconds old beats a
# prompt paragraph every time, so the fix is in the tool result: before a
# connector with a Composio twin says it is not set up, ask Composio.
#
# Asked live, not read from `_connections.md`: that file lags the connection
# by minutes (sync tick, or the app noticing the sign-in finished), and the
# moment right after connecting is exactly when the person asks. One call is
# ~2 s and only happens on the not-set-up path. A yes is remembered briefly;
# a no never is, because the next call may be the one after they connect.

    together they are what the absent sentence is built from, so that "set it
    up on your Mac" is only ever said about something the person can set up.

    **An omission is silence, not a denial.** A document that does not mention
    a target at all — an older Mac that predates a newly shipped connector —
    or that mentions the target without this action, says nothing about it:
    rule 8's "missing is not gone" binds a reader exactly as it binds the
    drain, and reading silence as a refusal is how one stale document on a
    Mac would silently withdraw a connector the person had just been given.
    Unseen, and hedge.

    Errors are HAND_UNSEEN, never HAND_ABSENT: this function decides whether
    a person is offered one of their own hands, and a vault that would not
    open is a fact about this machine, not about their Mac. The queue path
    below is where "this machine cannot write it down" is said, honestly and
    with the record's absence to back it.

# 2026-09-20, the owner's cloud machine, told to check his connections: it
# ran gmail_status, calendar_status, notes_status, imessage_status … — every
# one a Mac connector, every one answered "lives on your Mac … I've queued
# this" — and never named a single service connected through Composio,
# because nothing here listed them. There was no tool for the question; the
# model reached for the nearest nine.
#
# This is the tool for the question. It reads a FILE and nothing else — no
# probe, no network, no credential — so it is fast, and it cannot mint a
# connection the way COMPOSIO_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS does (the router skill's
# one warning). On a Mac the file is `context/_connections.md`, the same
# words the prompt already carries, written by `hermes-connections.py refresh`
# the instant a connection changes. On the machine it is the Mac's facts,
# `context/_connections.json`, travelled as the `context/connections`
# document and rendered here in the machine's own words (moeledger.connected)
# — so a Mac connector is named as living on the Mac, not offered as a status
# to queue. The per-connector `<name>_status` tools are untouched; this is

#
# 2026-09-25 and 2026-09-29, the owner, answering from the away machine:
# "report this bug to the Memoe team". Moe said there was "no ticket/feedback
# tool in my toolkit, and search turned up nothing", and "logged it in my
# notes" instead. Filing existed all along -- as a SKILL
# (hermes-skills/support/moe-tickets: SKILL.md + moe-ticket.py, run through
# the shell) -- and the claude-code child searches TOOLS. A skill is not in
# that index, so the search was honest and the report never went.
#
# This is the same script as a registered tool, in the `connectors` toolset
# so it sits on the direct surface on both runtimes (Hermes
# tools/tool_search.py `_DIRECT_SURFACE_TOOLSETS`), and every word a person
# uses for it -- report, ticket, bug, feedback, support, problem -- is in its
# description, which is what a tool search reads. The script stays the one
# place the privacy switch is checked, diagnostics are gathered and the words
# are scrubbed; this only hands it argv, never a shell, and relays what it
# printed. confirm-send.sh files the name as `local`, as the shell route
# through moe-ticket.py always was: the person asked, and the Settings ›
# Privacy switch is the consent.

#: Where the skill lands: `configure-hermes.py install_moe_skills` on a Mac
